          "answer": "Q. I am currently in the United States in another nonimmigrant status. Do I have to depart the United States to obtain H-1B nonimmigrant status?A. Nonimmigrants in the United States who wish to obtain a different nonimmigrant status generally either apply for a change of status with USCIS or, after USCIS approves their benefit request, consular process by applying for a visa in the new classification at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then requesting admission to the United States in the new classification.In general, you may change to H-1B nonimmigrant status without departing the United States. An employer who files an H-1B petition on your behalf can request a change of status on theForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. To be eligible to change your status, you must have been lawfully admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, your nonimmigrant status must remain valid, you must not have violated the conditions of your status, and you must not have committed any act that would make you ineligible to receive a nonimmigrant benefit. Also, certain nonimmigrant categories are ineligible for a change of status (seeChange My Nonimmigrant Statusfor a list).If you need to depart the United States – for example, if your current nonimmigrant status expires before your employer is able to file Form I-129 requesting a change of status to H-1B classification – you would generally need to apply for and obtain an H-1B visa stamp from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and present yourself at a port of entry for admission in H-1B status with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after the approval of the H-1B petition filed on your behalf.

          "question": "Q. How long may I remain in the United States in H-1B status?",
          "answer": "A. The maximum period of admission for H-1B workers is generally 6 years. However, as detailed below, there are some common exceptions to this limit. Q. When and how long can I extend my H-1B status beyond 6 years? A. Your employer may submitForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on your behalf, requesting an H-1B extension beyond 6 years in certain scenarios. For example, your employer may request to extend your H-1B status beyond 6 years if at least 365 days have passed since apermanent labor certificationwas filed on your behalf with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) or since an immigrant visa petition (typically Form I-140), enabling you to apply for lawful permanent residence once a visa is available, was filed on your behalf with USCIS under one of theemployment-based immigrant visa categories. We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 1-year increments. More commonly, your employer may also request to extend H-1B status beyond 6 years if you are the beneficiary of anapprovedForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, in thefirst, second, or third preference categoryand are eligible to be granted lawful permanent resident status, except for the fact that an immigrant visa is not available, as reflected in theU.S. Department of State Visa Bulletin. Your petitioning employer must demonstrate that the visa is not available as of the date the H-1B extension petition is filed with USCIS,as determined by your Form I-140 priority date and the relevant visa bulletin chart from the time of filing the H-1B extension request. See theUSCIS Policy Manualfor additional information on visa availability. We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 3-year increments. Additional information about extending H-1B status beyond 6 years, including specific requirements and points at which you are no longer eligible for such extensions, is available on ourH-1B Specialty Occupationspage under “Period of Stay.” Q. Must I presently hold H-1B status to request H-1B status beyond 6 years? A. You do not have to hold H-1B status at the time you request H-1B status beyond the sixth year. Regulations authorizing H-1B status beyond 6 years apply to individuals who are currently inor previously heldH-1B status. For example, imagine you previously held H-1B status for 6 years but had no basis to timely extend beyond 6 years before your 6 years in H-1B status were reached. You then changed to O-1 status. While in O-1 status, a Form I-140 petition in the first, second, or third preference category was approved on your behalf, but an immigrant visa is not available in the category under which you are adjusting status based on your priority date. Your employer may then file a petition requesting a 3-year period of H-1B status on your behalf. This petition could either request a change of status to H-1B while still in the United States, assuming you are otherwise eligible for a change of status, or consular notification. H-1B petitions approved by USCIS for consular processing are forwarded to the Department of State for review. After review, a U.S. Consulate or Embassy may issue a visa for travel to a United States’ port of entry. Q. Does my time outside of the United States count towards my 6-year maximum in H-1B status? A. Only time spent in the United States as an H-1B beneficiary counts towards the 6-year maximum. Time spent outside the United States exceeding 24 hours, commonly referred to as “recapture time” or “remainder time,” does not count towards your 6-year limit, and you are eligible to recapture those periods of time. The burden is on your petitioning employer to request and establish eligibility for recapture time. Documentation of time outside of the United States may include passport stamps, Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Records and travel history from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, airline tickets, and boarding passes, along with an accompanying chart indicating dates outside of the United States. Your petitioning employer may include such documentation to establish your eligibility for recapturing time when they submit an H-1B petition on your behalf. Q. I only work in H-1B status for short periods of time throughout the year. Does the 6-year maximum duration still apply to me? There is not a limitation of stay if your employment in the United States is seasonal or intermittent or for a total of 6 months or less per year, or if you do not reside continually in the United States. Your petitioning employer must provide clear and convincing proof that you qualify for such an exception of the 6-year maximum duration. This proof must consist of evidence such as arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad. Q. When can I begin a new 6-year period of H-1B status? A. You may be eligible to begin a new period of 6 years in H-1B status if you have been outside of the United States for 1 continuous year, with the exception of brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure.  If you start a new 6-year period of H-1B status you are subject toH-1B cap limitationsif your employment is cap-subject."

          "question": "Q. My H-1B status is about to expire. Do I have to leave the United States to extend my H-1B status?",
          "answer": "A. In general, you do not have to leave the United States to extend your H-1B status. Your employer can submit an H-1B petition with a request to extend your H-1B status. To be eligible to extend your status, you must have been lawfully admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, your nonimmigrant status must remain valid, you must not have violated the conditions of your status, and you must not have committed any act that would make you ineligible to receive a nonimmigrant benefit. If the H-1B petition requesting an extension of status on your behalf is filedafterthe end of your H-1B status period – in other words, if it was not “timely filed” -- then we, in our discretion and under certain conditions, may excuse the failure to timely file if the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control. If we approve the late-filed petition to extend status, the approval is effective as of the date of the expiration of your prior H-1B admission period. See theUSCIS Policy Manual. If we deny the extension of status request, whether it was filed on time or not, you will be considered to have been out of valid status as of the expiration date of your H-1B status that you sought to extend (in other words, your I-94 expiration date). Please see theUSCIS Policy Manualfor more information. Q. My H-1B status is about to expire but a petition requesting an H-1B extension on my behalf is pending at USCIS. What is my status once my H-1B expires? May I continue to work while the extension request is pending? If your H-1B expires and a timely-filed non-frivolous H-1B extension request is pending on your behalf, you are in a period of authorized stay – even after your H-1B status expires. Note, however, that an authorized period of stay is not the same as a status. If the petition is seeking extension of the same employment for the same employer, you are authorized to continue employment for a period not to exceed 240 days from the date your H-1B status expired. If we deny the extension request before the 240-day period expires, your employment authorization will automatically terminate when USCIS notifies your petitioning employer of the denial. If the petition is requesting a change in employment or change in employer under H-1B portability, you are authorized to work in the new employment for the entire time the petition is pending at USCIS. If we deny the request, your employment authorization based on portability will automatically terminate when USCIS notifies your petitioning employer of the denial. See “Changing Employers or Employment Terms with the Same Employer (Portability)” in ourH-1B Specialty Occupationwebpage. Q. What happens if my H-1B status expires while I have a pending application to change to another nonimmigrant status? A. A pending application to change status (Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, orForm I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status) does not provide lawful immigration status. However, you may be in an authorized period of stay during the period when a timely filed nonfrivolous application to change status is pending with USCIS. If we approve your timely-filed application to change status, the start date for your new nonimmigrant status is effective on the date of approval. If there is a gap of time between the expiration date of your H-1B status and the start date of your new status, we consider you to have continued to maintain a lawful status as long as you timely filed the change of status (COS) application, we granted the request to change status, and you did not violate any terms and conditions of your H-1B status. If your request to change status was not filed on time – in other words, if it was not filed before the end of your H-1B status -- then we, in our discretion and under certain conditions, may excuse the failure to timely file if the delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control. If we approve the late filed change of status application, the change of status takes effect on the approval date. In this scenario, we will consider you to have maintained lawful status during the excused period. See theUSCIS Policy Manual. If we deny the application to change status, whether it was filed on time or not, you will be considered to have been out of valid status as of the expiration date of your H-1B status (your I-94 expiration date). Q. What happens if my H-1B status expires and I have an approved compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document (EAD)? A. If your H-1B status expires and you have a compelling circumstances EAD, you will be in a period of authorized stay, but you will no longer be maintaining a nonimmigrant status. You generally will not accrue unlawful presence in the United States while the EAD is valid or, if you filed a non-frivolous application for the EAD before the expiration of your H-1B status, while your application was pending. If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and a nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is filed on your behalf, you would not be eligible to change status, extend status, or adjust status to lawful permanent resident from within the United States. After the petition is approved, you would need to apply for a visa and/or admission from outside the United States to begin working in accordance with that petition.

If we approve the late filed change of status application, the change of status takes effect on the approval date. In this scenario, we will consider you to have maintained lawful status during the excused period. See theUSCIS Policy Manual. If we deny the application to change status, whether it was filed on time or not, you will be considered to have been out of valid status as of the expiration date of your H-1B status (your I-94 expiration date). Q. What happens if my H-1B status expires and I have an approved compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document (EAD)? A. If your H-1B status expires and you have a compelling circumstances EAD, you will be in a period of authorized stay, but you will no longer be maintaining a nonimmigrant status. You generally will not accrue unlawful presence in the United States while the EAD is valid or, if you filed a non-frivolous application for the EAD before the expiration of your H-1B status, while your application was pending. If you are working in the United States under a compelling circumstances EAD and a nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is filed on your behalf, you would not be eligible to change status, extend status, or adjust status to lawful permanent resident from within the United States. After the petition is approved, you would need to apply for a visa and/or admission from outside the United States to begin working in accordance with that petition.

          "answer": "A. A company in which you have a controlling interest – meaning, you own more than 50% or have majority voting rights in the company – may qualify as your employer and may petition for H-1B status on your behalf. In this scenario you would be both an owner of the petitioning employer and a beneficiary of the petition (a “beneficiary owner”). You must still be coming temporarily to the United States to perform services in a specialty occupation. As a beneficiary owner, you must perform specialty occupation duties a majority of the time and may otherwise perform non-specialty occupation duties that are directly related to owning and directing your company, along with some incidental duties. The validity periods for the initial petition and first extension of such petition for beneficiary owners are limited to 18 months each. Additionally, Department of Labor requirements related to Labor Condition Applications, including requirements concerning the appropriate prevailing wage, still apply. See the final rule,Modernizing H-1B Requirements, Providing Flexibility in the F-1 Program, and Program Improvements Affecting Other Nonimmigrant Workers, published on Dec. 18, 2024, which clarifies how the H-1B regulations apply to beneficiary owners. The United States remains a destination for top talent around the world. Our ability to attract and retain entrepreneurs is essential for spurring innovation, job creation, and new industries and opportunities for all Americans. We encourage entrepreneurs to use the H-1B program, or other appropriate pathways, to live and work in the United States. SeeOptions for Alien Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States."

          "question": "Q. I hold H-1B status and have a pending adjustment of status application. If my H-1B expires, will my adjustment of status application be denied?",
          "answer": "A.A pending adjustment of status application does not provide lawful status or cure any violation of nonimmigrant visa status. If you file Form I-485 while you are in H-1B status, however, the expiration of that H-1B status while the Form I-485 is pending generally will not make you ineligible for adjustment of status, as long as you do not engage in unauthorized employment or otherwise become inadmissible. See theUSCIS Policy Manual. Q. I hold H-1B status and have a pending adjustment of status application. If my H-1B expires, may I continue to work and travel? A. A pendingForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, does not automatically confer employment authorization and does not serve as a basis for readmission to the United States. However, you may submit applications for employment authorization and advance parole with your Form I-485. If you fileForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on your pending Form I-485, and receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), you may use this EAD to work. EADs based on a pending adjustment of status application are unrestricted as to employment type and location. If you fileForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and receive an Advance Parole Document based on your pending Form I-485, you may present your valid Advance Parole Document at a port of entry for reentry to the United States. The validity period for your EAD will generally be5 years. If you file both Form I-131 and Form I-765 and USCIS approves both applications, we will generally issue one document which serves as both your EAD and Advance Parole Document (known as a combination card, or combo card). The combo card will be an EAD with the notation “SERVES AS I-512 ADVANCE PAROLE.” (SeeInformation About Your Immigration Document.) If you do not file the Form I-131 and I-765 together, and/or if we cannot adjudicate both applications together, you will receive separate employment authorization and Advance Parole Documents. In this case, your EAD will indicate “NOT VALID FOR REENTRY TO U.S.” and your Advance Parole Document will be issued separately. Q. I am an foreign student on an F-1 visa, currently in a period of optional practical training (OPT). Do I need to obtain H-1B status for my employer to file an immigrant petition on my behalf? A. As an F-1 student on OPT, you do not have to obtain H-1B status before an immigrant petition is filed on your behalf. In general, nonimmigrants are admitted for a specific temporary period of time and, at the time of admission or extension of stay, must intend to depart the United States at the expiration of their authorized period of admission or extension of stay. See theUSCIS Policy Manual. To be eligible for F-1 classification, a student must intend to depart the United States after their temporary period of stay and have a foreign residence they do not intend to abandon. However, as a student you may be the beneficiary of a pending or approved immigrant petition and still be able to demonstrate an intent to depart. See theUSCIS Policy Manual. Q. I have an approved immigrant petition and am waiting for a visa number to be available. Why is there such a long wait for a visa number to be available to me? A. Availability of immigrant visas is subject to statutory limits, and demand for these visas is generally much higher than the limits can accommodate. Statutory constraints on immigrant visa numbers can only be changed by Congress. SeeEmployment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQsfor additional information. Q. I have now become a lawful permanent resident. Do any employment restrictions apply to me? What guidance is available? A. As a lawful permanent resident you are authorized to work for any employer. You may use your Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) for readmission to the United States after travel abroad, though if you are outside of the country for a long duration – generally 1 year or more – you may need to apply for a reentry permit. Note that, depending on the length and circumstances of the trip abroad, the trip may lead to a determination that you have abandoned your lawful permanent resident status. (See theUSCIS Policy Manual). Additional conditions and requirements apply to those granted conditional permanent resident status, usually granted to those who applied for lawful permanent residence based on marriage or investment.

          "question": "Q. What is “porting”?",
          "answer": "A. There are two kinds of job portability, or “porting,” available based on two different kinds of employer petitions: H-1B petition portability:Eligible H-1B nonimmigrants may begin working for a new employer as soon as the employer properly files a new H-1B petition (Form I-129) requesting to amend or extend H-1B status with USCIS, without waiting for the petition to be approved. More information about H-1B portability can be found on ourH-1B Specialty Occupationspage. Immigrant worker petition portability:A worker with an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) that has been pending for at least 180 days with an underlying valid immigrant visa petition (Form I-140) can transfer the underlying immigrant visa petition to a qualifying new offer of employment in the same or similar occupational classification with the same or a new employer. For example, if you move from a software developer position to an information systems manager position, this may be considered a same or similar occupation. More information about this kind of porting (sometimes known as “INA 204(j)portability”) can be found in theUSCIS Policy Manual. If you seek to port to a new offer of employment under INA 204(j), you must submitForm I-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j), to document your new job offer and transfer your Form I-140 to the new job offer. If the Form I-140 is in an employment-based immigrant visa category which does not require a job offer – namely, individuals seeking anational interest waiverof the job offer requirement or individuals seeking classification as a person ofextraordinary ability– you do not need to request job portability under INA 204(j). Eligibility for immigrant visa classifications and specific requirements are described in theUSCIS Policy Manualand in theEmployment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs. Q. How do I leave my current employer to start working for a new employer while remaining in H-1B status? A. Under H-1B portability provisions, you may begin working for a new employer as soon as they properly file a non-frivolous H-1B petition on your behalf, or as of the requested start date on the petition, whichever is later. You arenotrequired to wait for the new employer’s H-1B petition to be approved before beginning to work for the new employer, assuming certain conditions are met. For more details about H-1B portability, see ourH-1B Specialty Occupationspage, under “Changing Employers or Employment Terms with the Same Employer (Portability).” Q. What are my options if my H-1B employment is terminated? A. When nonimmigrant workers are laid off, they may not be aware of their options and may, in some instances, wrongly assume that they have no option but to leave the country within 60 days. If your employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, you typically may take one of the following actions, if you are eligible, to remain in a period of authorized stay in the United States: File an application for a change of nonimmigrant status;File an application for adjustment of status;File an application for a compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document; orBe the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer. If one of these actions occurs within the up to 60-day grace period, your period of authorized stay in the United States can exceed 60 days, even if you lose your previous nonimmigrant status. If you take no action within the grace period, you and your dependents may then need to depart the United States within 60 days, or when your authorized validity period ends, whichever is shorter. For more detailed information, see our page onOptions for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment. Q. My employer filed a Form I-140 immigrant worker petition on my behalf. What happens if I leave my job, or if my employer withdraws the Form I-140? Will I retain my priority date? Am I still eligible to adjust status? A. First, let’s assume that your priority date is not yet current (meaning it is not earlier than the applicable cutoff date in the Visa Bulletin). Starting from the moment that the Form I-140 filed on your behalf is approved: Your priority date is generally locked in for use in subsequently filed Form I-140 petitions (also known as priority date retention). The only way you can lose your priority date is if the I-140 approval is revoked on certain grounds such as agency error, fraud, or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.If you are otherwise eligible for H-1B status, this I-140 approval may be the basis to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year period of admission limitation, in up to 3-year increments.Your spouse, if in H-4 nonimmigrant status or seeking a change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant status, would be eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document. Within 180 days of the Form I-140 approval, if your employer withdraws the I-140 petition approval that was filed on your behalf, USCIS is obligated to automatically revoke the I-140 approval.Youwould not lose your priority date, but you would need a new basis in order to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year limitation and ultimately adjust status. After the Form I-140 filed on your behalf has been approved for at least 180 days, however: Even if your employer withdraws the Form I-140 approval, USCIS would not revoke the I-140 approval for that reason alone. You would continue to have an approved I-140, and would continue to be eligible for H-1B extensions beyond the general 6-year limitation if you are otherwise eligible for H-1B status. USCIS would only revoke the I-140 approval on certain grounds such as agency error, fraud, or misrepresentation of a material fact. You would, however, need a new basis on which to seek adjustment of status. Next, let’s assume that your priority date becomes current, you have an approved I-140, and you properly fileForm I-485(the application to adjust status). Once your Form I-485 has beenpendingfor 180 days, you can “port” the offer of employment in the Form I-140 approval to a new job offer (same or different employer) as long as the new job offer is in a “same or similar” occupational classification when compared to the job offer in the Form I-140 petition. The new employer does not have to submit a new I-140 on your behalf, although you would need to file a “Supplement J” to request this job portability. (Technically, you can submit a Supplement J to port apendingI-140 even before it’s approved, but this scenario is less common. See the relevantform instructionson when you must submit a Supplement J.) Finally, let’s consider one alternative scenario: More than 365 days have passed since the filing of aPERM labor certification applicationor a Form I-140 petition on your behalf: You are eligible to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year limitation, in up to 1-year increments. (As described above, the 3-year increments are only possible with anapprovedI-140 and a priority date that isnotcurrent.)  Thus, even if you are not eligible for the up to 3-year extension because your priority date is current, you may still be eligible for extensions in increments of up to 1 year if at least 365 days have passed since the filing of the PERM labor certification application or Form I-140 petition (or other employment-based immigrant petition, such as Form I-360) on your behalf.Your spouse, if in H-4 nonimmigrant status or seeking a change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant status, would be eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document if you have been granted an extension beyond the end of the general 6-year limitation on this basis. Q. My employer filed a Form I-140 on my behalf, but I would now like to leave that employer and focus on my start-up company. Is it possible to “port” to self-employment and still adjust status? A. If you are the beneficiary of an approved Form I-140 petition or a pending Form I-140 petition that is ultimately approved and you have an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be able to port the offer of employment on which your application was based to self-employment in the same or similar occupational classification by filing a request to port using Form I-485 Supplement J.  The petition must be in the employment-based 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference category. To determine if the self-employment is in the same or similar occupational classification as the job listed on the petition, USCIS evaluates the totality of the circumstances and may consider and compare various factors and evidence relating to the jobs, including the U.S. Department of Labor occupational codes assigned to the respective jobs; job duties; job titles; the required skills and experience; the educational and training requirements; any licenses or certifications specifically required; the offered wage or salary; and any other material and credible evidence relevant to a determination of whether the new position is in the same or a similar occupational classification. Your request to port should also contain sufficient evidence to confirm that your business and the new job offer are legitimate. If the submitted evidence is insufficient, or if the officer identifies indicators that raise doubts about the legitimacy of the self-employment, the officer may request additional evidence from you. In reviewing a request to port, USCIS considers whether the petition accurately represented the intended employment at the time both the petition and the adjustment application were filed. This means that, at the time the petition was filed and at the time the adjustment application was filed (if not filed concurrently), the original petitioner must have intended to employ you in a permanent position, and you must also have intended to undertake the employment upon adjustment. See theUSCIS Policy Manualfor additional information on porting and considerations for the same or similar occupational classification analysis. Q. I have an approved Form I-140 but I know I will be waiting a long time for an immigrant visa to become available. Do I need to be the beneficiary of a valid, approved Form I-140 for the whole time I’m waiting? A. You are not required to be the beneficiary of a valid, approved Form I-140 for the entire time you are waiting for an immigrant visa to become available. Generally, your first approved Form I-140 establishes your priority date. Youdoneed a valid Form I-140 once an immigrant visa becomes available and you file your Form I-485, but it doesnotneed to be the same I-140 that you used to establish your priority date. In other words, an H-1B worker could establish their priority date with an approved I-140 from Employer A, then use H-1B petition portability to work for a number of other employers who donotfile an I-140, and ultimately apply to adjust status based on a second approved I-140 from Employer Z (or use the approved I-140 from Employer A to “port” to a same or similar job offer from Employer Z, if eligible). Please see the previous Q&A for more details about these scenarios. Q. I believe my employer has retaliated against me. What protections are available to me? A. You have a right to be protected from retaliation regardless of your immigration status. Immigration law may provide certain protections to you as an H-1B worker if you report suspected fraud or abuse. Normally, H‑1B workers are not eligible to extend or change their status if they have lost or failed to maintain their H-1B status. However, if they can demonstrate “extraordinary circumstances,” we may use our discretion to excuse this requirement on a case-by-case basis. We may consider a situation to be an instance of “extraordinary circumstances” if you: apply to extend your H-1B status or change your nonimmigrant status,indicate that you faced retaliatory action from your employer because you reported a Labor Condition Application violation,provide credible documentary evidence of such a report and retaliation, andlost or failed to maintain your H-1B status. For more details, seeCombating Fraud and Abuse in the H-1B Visa Program. For more general information on worker protections, visitWorker.gov.

When nonimmigrant workers are laid off, they may not be aware of their options and may, in some instances, wrongly assume that they have no option but to leave the country within 60 days. If your employment is terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, you typically may take one of the following actions, if you are eligible, to remain in a period of authorized stay in the United States: File an application for a change of nonimmigrant status;File an application for adjustment of status;File an application for a compelling circumstances Employment Authorization Document; orBe the beneficiary of a nonfrivolous petition to change employer. If one of these actions occurs within the up to 60-day grace period, your period of authorized stay in the United States can exceed 60 days, even if you lose your previous nonimmigrant status. If you take no action within the grace period, you and your dependents may then need to depart the United States within 60 days, or when your authorized validity period ends, whichever is shorter. For more detailed information, see our page onOptions for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment. Q. My employer filed a Form I-140 immigrant worker petition on my behalf. What happens if I leave my job, or if my employer withdraws the Form I-140? Will I retain my priority date? Am I still eligible to adjust status? A. First, let’s assume that your priority date is not yet current (meaning it is not earlier than the applicable cutoff date in the Visa Bulletin). Starting from the moment that the Form I-140 filed on your behalf is approved: Your priority date is generally locked in for use in subsequently filed Form I-140 petitions (also known as priority date retention). The only way you can lose your priority date is if the I-140 approval is revoked on certain grounds such as agency error, fraud, or willful misrepresentation of a material fact.If you are otherwise eligible for H-1B status, this I-140 approval may be the basis to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year period of admission limitation, in up to 3-year increments.Your spouse, if in H-4 nonimmigrant status or seeking a change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant status, would be eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document. Within 180 days of the Form I-140 approval, if your employer withdraws the I-140 petition approval that was filed on your behalf, USCIS is obligated to automatically revoke the I-140 approval.Youwould not lose your priority date, but you would need a new basis in order to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year limitation and ultimately adjust status. After the Form I-140 filed on your behalf has been approved for at least 180 days, however: Even if your employer withdraws the Form I-140 approval, USCIS would not revoke the I-140 approval for that reason alone. You would continue to have an approved I-140, and would continue to be eligible for H-1B extensions beyond the general 6-year limitation if you are otherwise eligible for H-1B status. USCIS would only revoke the I-140 approval on certain grounds such as agency error, fraud, or misrepresentation of a material fact. You would, however, need a new basis on which to seek adjustment of status. Next, let’s assume that your priority date becomes current, you have an approved I-140, and you properly fileForm I-485(the application to adjust status). Once your Form I-485 has beenpendingfor 180 days, you can “port” the offer of employment in the Form I-140 approval to a new job offer (same or different employer) as long as the new job offer is in a “same or similar” occupational classification when compared to the job offer in the Form I-140 petition. The new employer does not have to submit a new I-140 on your behalf, although you would need to file a “Supplement J” to request this job portability. (Technically, you can submit a Supplement J to port apendingI-140 even before it’s approved, but this scenario is less common. See the relevantform instructionson when you must submit a Supplement J.) Finally, let’s consider one alternative scenario: More than 365 days have passed since the filing of aPERM labor certification applicationor a Form I-140 petition on your behalf: You are eligible to extend your H-1B status beyond the general 6-year limitation, in up to 1-year increments. (As described above, the 3-year increments are only possible with anapprovedI-140 and a priority date that isnotcurrent.)  Thus, even if you are not eligible for the up to 3-year extension because your priority date is current, you may still be eligible for extensions in increments of up to 1 year if at least 365 days have passed since the filing of the PERM labor certification application or Form I-140 petition (or other employment-based immigrant petition, such as Form I-360) on your behalf.Your spouse, if in H-4 nonimmigrant status or seeking a change of status to H-4 nonimmigrant status, would be eligible to apply for an Employment Authorization Document if you have been granted an extension beyond the end of the general 6-year limitation on this basis. Q. My employer filed a Form I-140 on my behalf, but I would now like to leave that employer and focus on my start-up company. Is it possible to “port” to self-employment and still adjust status? A. If you are the beneficiary of an approved Form I-140 petition or a pending Form I-140 petition that is ultimately approved and you have an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be able to port the offer of employment on which your application was based to self-employment in the same or similar occupational classification by filing a request to port using Form I-485 Supplement J.  The petition must be in the employment-based 1st, 2nd, or 3rd preference category. To determine if the self-employment is in the same or similar occupational classification as the job listed on the petition, USCIS evaluates the totality of the circumstances and may consider and compare various factors and evidence relating to the jobs, including the U.S. Department of Labor occupational codes assigned to the respective jobs; job duties; job titles; the required skills and experience; the educational and training requirements; any licenses or certifications specifically required; the offered wage or salary; and any other material and credible evidence relevant to a determination of whether the new position is in the same or a similar occupational classification. Your request to port should also contain sufficient evidence to confirm that your business and the new job offer are legitimate. If the submitted evidence is insufficient, or if the officer identifies indicators that raise doubts about the legitimacy of the self-employment, the officer may request additional evidence from you. In reviewing a request to port, USCIS considers whether the petition accurately represented the intended employment at the time both the petition and the adjustment application were filed. This means that, at the time the petition was filed and at the time the adjustment application was filed (if not filed concurrently), the original petitioner must have intended to employ you in a permanent position, and you must also have intended to undertake the employment upon adjustment. See theUSCIS Policy Manualfor additional information on porting and considerations for the same or similar occupational classification analysis. Q. I have an approved Form I-140 but I know I will be waiting a long time for an immigrant visa to become available. Do I need to be the beneficiary of a valid, approved Form I-140 for the whole time I’m waiting? A. You are not required to be the beneficiary of a valid, approved Form I-140 for the entire time you are waiting for an immigrant visa to become available. Generally, your first approved Form I-140 establishes your priority date. Youdoneed a valid Form I-140 once an immigrant visa becomes available and you file your Form I-485, but it doesnotneed to be the same I-140 that you used to establish your priority date. In other words, an H-1B worker could establish their priority date with an approved I-140 from Employer A, then use H-1B petition portability to work for a number of other employers who donotfile an I-140, and ultimately apply to adjust status based on a second approved I-140 from Employer Z (or use the approved I-140 from Employer A to “port” to a same or similar job offer from Employer Z, if eligible). Please see the previous Q&A for more details about these scenarios. Q. I believe my employer has retaliated against me. What protections are available to me? A. You have a right to be protected from retaliation regardless of your immigration status. Immigration law may provide certain protections to you as an H-1B worker if you report suspected fraud or abuse. Normally, H‑1B workers are not eligible to extend or change their status if they have lost or failed to maintain their H-1B status. However, if they can demonstrate “extraordinary circumstances,” we may use our discretion to excuse this requirement on a case-by-case basis. We may consider a situation to be an instance of “extraordinary circumstances” if you: apply to extend your H-1B status or change your nonimmigrant status,indicate that you faced retaliatory action from your employer because you reported a Labor Condition Application violation,provide credible documentary evidence of such a report and retaliation, andlost or failed to maintain your H-1B status.

Please see the previous Q&A for more details about these scenarios. Q. I believe my employer has retaliated against me. What protections are available to me? A. You have a right to be protected from retaliation regardless of your immigration status. Immigration law may provide certain protections to you as an H-1B worker if you report suspected fraud or abuse. Normally, H‑1B workers are not eligible to extend or change their status if they have lost or failed to maintain their H-1B status. However, if they can demonstrate “extraordinary circumstances,” we may use our discretion to excuse this requirement on a case-by-case basis. We may consider a situation to be an instance of “extraordinary circumstances” if you: apply to extend your H-1B status or change your nonimmigrant status,indicate that you faced retaliatory action from your employer because you reported a Labor Condition Application violation,provide credible documentary evidence of such a report and retaliation, andlost or failed to maintain your H-1B status. For more details, seeCombating Fraud and Abuse in the H-1B Visa Program. For more general information on worker protections, visitWorker.gov.

          "question": "Q. My employer filed an H-1B petition on my behalf, and it is pending at USCIS. If I travel internationally, will the H-1B petition be affected?",
          "answer": "A. Only a beneficiary who is continuing to maintain nonimmigrant status may apply for a change of status. If you depart the United States while a petition requesting a change of status to H-1B is pending, we will consider the change of status request abandoned. If we approve the petition, the approval notice will be issued as a consular notification and will not confer H-1B status. In this scenario, you would generally need to apply for and obtain an H-1B visa stamp from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and present yourself for admission to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to obtain H-1B status. See theU.S. Department of State websitefor information on the visa application process and theCBP websitefor information on travel to the United States. You must be physically present in the United States at the time your employer files a petition requesting an extension of stay on your behalf. However, departure from the United States while an H-1B petition requesting an extension of stay is pending will generally not serve as a basis to deny the extension request. Your employer may request that USCIS send notification of the H-1B extension approval to the consular office abroad where you will apply for a visa. Q. I am in the process of applying for lawful permanent resident status while holding H-1B status. Will international travel affect my adjustment of status application? A. For most adjustment of status applicants, if you depart the United States with a pendingForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, without first obtaining an advance parole document, we will deny Form I-485 for abandonment. Exceptions to this rule exist for a narrow set of nonimmigrants, including those holding valid H-1B status. An individual in H-1B status who is not under exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings may travel while Form I-485 is pending without first obtaining an advance parole document if: Upon returning to the United States they remain eligible for H-1B status;They are returning to the United States to resume employment with the same employer for which their H-1B is authorized; andThey are in possession of a valid H-1B visa. Alternatively, an individual in H-1B status who has a pending Form I-485 and who has been granted an Advance Parole Document based on an approvedForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Recordsmay depart the United States without abandoning their Form I-485 application, so long as they depart and return during the advance parole document’s validity period. Q. I filed Form I-131 requesting advance parole and Form I-765 requesting employment authorization with my Form I-485. If I leave the United States before the advance parole and employment authorization are issued, will the applications be denied? A. Departure from the United States generally will not on its own serve as a basis of denial ofForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, orForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records."

          "question": "Q. Can my H-4 dependent family members work?",
          "answer": "A. H-4 dependents are not automatically employment authorized on the basis of their nonimmigrant status. Only H-4 dependents who affirmatively apply for and receive employment authorization from USCIS are authorized to work, and only certain H-4s are eligible for employment authorization. H-4 spouses may fileForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, if the H-1B worker is the beneficiary of an approvedForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, or has been granted H-1B status beyond 6 years based on 365 days having passed since a labor certification was filed with the Department of Labor or an immigrant visa petition was filed with USCIS on the H-1B worker’s behalf. SeeEmployment Authorization for Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses. Q. Are my H-4 dependent family members also subject to the 6-year maximum period of stay? A. Dependent family members’ time in H-4 status is generally limited to the duration of the H-1B worker’s status. If an individual obtains H-1B extensions beyond 6 years, then their H-4 dependent family members are also eligible for extension of H-4 status for that same duration. Time spent in H-4 status does not count towards the 6-year maximum for H-1B status, so an individual who has spent 6 years in H-4 status my still obtain their own H-1B status for a period of 6 years. Q. I am seeking lawful permanent resident status with my dependent family members, including my H-4 child. What happens when my H-4 child turns 21? Are they still eligible for LPR status? A. Once your child turns 21 or gets married, they no longer meet the definition of a child under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and therefore will no longer be eligible for H-4 status.  At this point, to maintain nonimmigrant status your child would need to change to another nonimmigrant status – for example, F-1 or H-1B – for which they independently qualify. Additionally, they may still be eligible to adjust status or apply for an immigrant visa under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA), which protects certain beneficiaries from losing eligibility for adjustment of status and immigrant visas due to aging during the immigration process. If your child benefits from the CSPA, they will still lose their H-4 status after turning 21, but they will remain eligible to adjust status as a derivative beneficiary of your own adjustment of status application and immigrant worker petition despite being age 21 or over, assuming otherwise eligible. See theUSCIS Policy Manualfor detailed information about CSPA, as well asEmployment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs(Family Members)."

          "question": "Q. What actions has USCIS taken to support H-1B nonimmigrants seeking to adjust or change status in the United States?",
          "answer": "Congress sets theannual immigrant visa limits. Historically, demand for these visas, regardless of country of origin, is much higher than the annual limits can accommodate. USCIS has taken several actions to help those who will be waiting a long time for an “immediately available” immigrant visa number, including a 2015 rule that allows certainspouses of H-1B nonimmigrantsto apply for employment authorization, and a 2016 rule that hasimproved job flexibilityfor H-1B workers and their families. More recent improvements since 2021 include the following: Operational improvements In coordination with the Department of State, using all availableemployment-based visasfor fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, apart from those visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the employment-based visa limit for the following fiscal year.Increasing the maximum validity period of Employment Authorization Documents (EADs)to 5 years for adjustment of status applicants and bringing back “combo cards” that provide evidence of both employment authorization and advance parole.Expandingpremium processingto all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, as well as certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status.Updating policy guidance onexpedite requests, including when USCIS may expedite adjudication of an Application for Travel Document (Form I-131) when an applicant demonstrates a pressing or critical need to leave the United States, whether the need to travel relates to aplanned or unplannedevent. In addition, the guidance clarifiesexpedite requests supported by a government agency.Removing the biometrics fee and appointment requirement forapplicants for a change or extension of nonimmigrant status(Form I-539).Announcing process enhancements fordeferred action requests by workers, including H-1B workers, to support labor and employment agency investigations.Making progress on reducing processing times. Policy improvements On Dec. 18, DHS published a final rule to improve the H-1B program by modernizing and providing program efficiencies, increasing benefits and flexibilities, and strengthening integrity measures. Among other provisions, this rule revises the definition of and criteria for specialty occupation positions to codify current practice; codifies the deference policy under which adjudicators generally should defer to a prior determination when no underlying facts have changed; modernizes H-1B cap exemptions; extends“cap-gap” protectionsfor F-1 students changing status to H-1B; codifies H-1B eligibility for beneficiary owners; and implements a number of integrity measures pertaining to site visits and third-party placements.Strengthening the integrity of the H-1B program with afinal rulethat created a new beneficiary-centric selection process for the FY 2025 H-1B registration period. This new rule has resulted in dramatically fewer attempts to game the system, as evidenced byH-1B registration data. In addition, under the new beneficiary-centric selection process, if a worker has multiple legitimate job offers and any of these registrations are selected, then the worker may choose which employer to work for.Updatingpolicy guidance for foreign students, including clarification that F and M students must have a foreign residence that they do not intend to abandon, but that such students may be the beneficiary of a permanent labor certification application or immigrant visa petition and may still be able to demonstrate their intention to depart after a temporary period of stay. In addition, the guidance specifies how F students seeking an extension of optional practical training (OPT) based on their degree in a STEM field may be employed by startup companies, as long as the employer adheres to the training plan requirements, remains in good standing with E-Verify, and provides compensation commensurate to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers, among other requirements.Updating the agency’s interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to provideadditional protection for child beneficiaries of alien workersfrom “aging out” of child status and allowing them to seek permanent residence along status with their parents, including clarification of the“sought to acquire” requirement.Publishing  updated guidance on when a Form I-140 beneficiary may transfer, or “port,” to a new job, providingclarity to those seeking to change employersduring the lengthy process of becoming a lawful permanent resident. Greater clarity Publishing resources fornonimmigrant workers following termination of employment, to ensure that nonimmigrant workers who are laid off are aware of options that may permit them to remain in the country past the regular 60 day grace period.Issuing guidance on the eligibility criteria forcompelling circumstances Employment Authorization Documents(EADs). For example, a principal applicant with an approved immigrant visa petition in an oversubscribed visa category or chargeability area, who has lived in the United States for a significant amount of time, could submit evidence such as school or higher education enrollment records, mortgage records, or long-term lease records to support a potential finding of compelling circumstances. Compelling circumstances could include, if, due to job loss, the family may otherwise be forced to sell their home for a loss, pull their children out of school, and relocate to their home country.Publishing information on the full range of options forSTEM professionalsandentrepreneursto work in the United States, and issuing new policy guidance to provide clarity for:Individuals of extraordinary ability (O-1)Individuals of extraordinary ability and outstanding professors and researchers (EB-1)Individuals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability who can self-petition with a National Interest Waiver (EB-2 NIW)Start-up founders growing their companies in the United States under theInternational Entrepreneur Rule. Meanwhile, the Department of State has launched anEarly Career STEM Research Initiativeas part of the J-1 visa program, as well as adomestic visa renewalpilot program. We will keep working within our legal authority to provide as much flexibility, predictability, and dignity as possible for all those waiting for their chance to become a lawful permanent resident and ultimately a U.S. citizen."

      "last_updated": "10/8/2024)Q. What information is available regarding how many pending Forms I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, USCIS currently has in its inventory in the employment-based categories by country of chargeability?A. We publish an inventory report, Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status - Pending Applications for Employment-Based Preference Categories, intended to provide information about the number of pending Forms I-485 in the employment-based preference categories. The report provides our estimate of how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory for each employment-based preference category, by selected country of chargeability, and by the month and year of the estimated priority date. An alien with a pending adjustment of status application can use the report to estimate how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory with earlier priority dates for their employment-based preference category and country of chargeability. Wait times for an employment-based immigrant visa depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, supply of visas and demand of visas for a particular preference category (at USCIS and the Department of State (DOS)), priority date, the country to which a visa will be charged (usually an applicant’s country of birth), and statutory limitations (for example, per country caps). The report does not include all those who may eventually be eligible for employment-based immigrant visas.  How to Read This Report:This report provides an overview of the estimated volume of pending adjustment of status applications in the employment-based preference categories currently in the USCIS inventory. To determine how many adjustment of status applications in a particular category and country of chargeability have a priority date earlier than a given priority date, first find the sheet in the report with the relevant country of chargeability. Next, determine the relevant “Preference Category” and find the month and year of the priority date to see the volume of pending adjustment of status applications before that preference category and priority date. Every application on the report with a priority date that is earlier than the given priority date is ahead in the queue for adjustment of status. Please note, however, that this report does not contain information about DOS inventory, nor does it have any information about aliens with pending or approved immigrant visa petitions who have not yet applied for adjustment of status. Note also that this report reflects an estimate based on data available at the time the report was generated. The number of pending applications with older priority dates may change, not only as visas become available and applications are approved but also because of other factors, such as new Form I-485 applications based on older priority dates due to priority date retention or applications transferring from one basis to another (for example, an application transferring from a Form I-140 in the EB-3 category to a Form I-140 in the EB-2 category). This report also contains no information about pending applications for permanent labor certifications or prevailing wage determination requests at the Department of Labor. Therefore, it does not provide a complete picture of those in the queue for employment-based immigrant visas. (Added 05/14/2024)  Q. How many employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and the Department of State (DOS) use during FY 2023?A. DOS determined that the FY 2023 employment-based annual limit was 197,091, due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2022 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2023. In addition, 6,396 EB-5 visas carried over from FY 2022 to FY 2023 in the reserved subcategories. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2023, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 10,874 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 147,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States. (Updated 03/07/2024)Q. Can the quarterly reports issued by USCIS or DHS be used to determine quarterly employment-based visa use?A. No. Our Immigration and Citizenship Data “All USCIS Application and Petition Form Types” and “Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485)” quarterly reports do not provide a comprehensive picture of employment-based visa use. The quarterly reports do not include the visas issued by our partners at DOS, and before FY 2023 they included the 4th preference employment-based categories under “other.” The quarterly “Legal Immigration and Adjustment of Status” reports published by the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics include adjustments of status but capture immigrant admissions at ports of entry rather than immigrant visa issuance by DOS, and as a result do not reflect year-to-date visa use. Neither report can be used to determine the number of employment-based immigrant visas used during a quarter. Also, USCIS reminds the public that, as noted in the Monthly Immigrant Visa Issuance Statistics reports webpage published by DOS, “individual monthly issuance reports should not be aggregated, as this will not provide an accurate issuance total for the fiscal year to date.” (Updated 10/8/2024)Q. How many family-sponsored or employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and DOS use during FY 2022?A. The Department of State (DOS) determined that the FY 2022 employment-based annual limit was 281,507 – more than double the typical annual total – due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2021 being allocated to the next fiscal year’s available employment-based visas. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 6,396 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 220,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for people already present in the United States.DOS determined that the FY 2022 family-sponsored annual limit was 226,000. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies had used 168,917 of the available visas. Of these, USCIS and EOIR approved more than 12,000 family-sponsored adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States. The approximately 57,000 unused family-sponsored visa numbers from FY 2022 are added to the FY 2023 employment-based limit. (Updated 03/22/2023)Q. Would you please summarize the changes we see in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin?A. With the start of fiscal year 2024, DOS can begin allocating employment-based visa numbers from the FY 2024 limit, estimated to be 161,000. As a result, we see a measure of recovery from the retrogressions of FY 2023 in all categories. Every Final Action Date in the Visa Bulletin has advanced from its level in September 2023 (or remained the same), and on Oct. 1, 2023, USCIS and DOS began completing the adjudication of applications filed by aliens for whom visas became available. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. Why have the dates in some categories in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin not advanced sufficiently to allow new applications?A. USCIS and DOS have significant volumes of employment-based adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications in their inventories. For some categories, including EB-2 and EB-3 for aliens chargeable to India, the agencies already have sufficient applications on hand to use up all of the available visas for FY 2024 and several fiscal years in the future. INA 203 requires that DOS make “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year…and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” In addition, INA 245 requires, among other things, an immigrant visa to be “immediately available” at the time an application for adjustment of status is filed. Given these statutory provisions, when the agencies already have enough inventory to use several years’ supply of immigrant visas in a particular category, it is not reasonable to advance the dates in the Visa Bulletin to allow the filing of new applications. (Added 9/15/2023)Q. What does the October 2023 Visa Bulletin reveal about fiscal year 2024 and future fiscal years?A. As the agencies rebuild normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer unused family-based immigrant visa numbers are carrying over to increase the number of available employment-based immigrant visas in FY 2024. In the years ahead, once there are no more unused family-based numbers, the annual number of available employment-based immigrant visas should return to 140,000.This limit, established by Congress more than three decades ago, is insufficient to meet the demand for employment-based immigrant visas in every category. Barring a change to the statute or an unexpected reduction in aliens seeking employment-based immigrant visas, aliens from all countries can expect to see longer waits for immigrant visas.Within EB-1, the category remains “Current” for aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China and the Final Action Dates have advanced for both India and China compared to the September 2023 Visa Bulletin.Within EB-2, demand for visas from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China is so high that for the first time ever, the category is not “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of a fiscal year.The same is true in EB-3, where demand from countries other than India and China is very high and so the category will not be “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of the fiscal year for the first time since FY 2018. The Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to India and China in this category have advanced, reflecting the available visas for FY 2024.As has been true for the past few years, high demand in the EW (Other Worker) category from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China means that such aliens will still face a significant wait for visa availability.In EB-4, the Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to all countries has advanced.Visas will continue to be available to all aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China in the EB-5 category. Aliens chargeable to China will continue to benefit from the special statutory exception to the per-country levels in the EB-5 category, and this is reflected by the advancing dates in the Visa Bulletin. The dates for aliens chargeable to India in the EB-5 category have also advanced but the category is not “Current,” reflecting the fact that increased demand in the EB-5 category by such aliens is greater than the available supply of visas. (Added 9/15/2023)Q. With increasingly long waits for employment-based immigrant visas for aliens from every country and in most categories, what has USCIS done to help those affected?A. We are committed to working with Congress to find durable solutions to address the imbalance between the high demand for immigrant visas and the decades-old annual statutory limits. We continue to emphasize that this imbalance needs to be addressed and that only Congress can alleviate the statutory constraint on immigrant visa numbers.At the same time, we continue to pursue policy and regulatory changes to bring greater certainty, stability, and protection for employer-sponsored aliens (as well as self-petitioners, special immigrants and immigrant investors) in the United States. Recent such measures include:Establishing a 5-year validity period for employment authorization documents (EADs)  issued to aliens with pending adjustment of status applications, effective Sept. 27, 2023;Clarifying eligibility criteria for O-1A and O-1B individuals of extraordinary ability;Updating USCIS Policy Manual guidance regarding eligibility for the EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and Outstanding Professor or Researcher visa categories;Clarifying eligibility for EB-2 individuals of exceptional ability and advanced degree holders with national interest waivers;Updating the USCIS interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to prevent some child beneficiaries from aging out of child status and allowing them to adjust immigration status with their parents;Clarifying the evidence required for physicians seeking a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement;Clarifying eligibility criteria and standards for applications for compelling circumstances employment authorization documents (EADs);Clarifying eligibility for J-1 exchange visitor status;Clarifying options for workers whose employment has terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to remain in the United States while securing new employment;Updating and expanding the list of degree fields qualifying alien graduates of U.S. universities for STEM optional practical training (OPT);Clarifying that USCIS considers certain E-1, E-2, E-3 and L-2 nonimmigrant dependent spouses employment authorized incident to status, such that they are not required to apply and wait for an EAD, and applying the automatic extension of employment authorization for renewal EAD applications filed by these E and L spouses as well as certain H-4 spouses;Establishing a process for healthcare and childcare workers to make an expedited request for processing of initial EAD applications that have been pending for more than 90 days, or renewal applications that would expire within 30 days or have already expired;Expanding premium processing to all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, and certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, while adhering to the congressional requirement that such services must not cause an increase in processing times for regular immigration benefit requests;Launching a new online form for individuals, attorneys, and accredited representatives to request an in-person appointment at their local field office without having to call the USCIS Contact Center. (Updated  12/8/2023)Q. How successful have the agencies been in using the available employment-based visas?A. For every fiscal year since FY 2007, with the exceptions of FY 2020 and FY 2021, USCIS and DOS have either used all of the available employment-based visas or fallen short by less than 1% of the annual limit. The 2-year period between FY 2020-2021 saw significantly higher than usual annual limits, and the shortfall of visa use in these fiscal years was caused by a shortage of financial resources and COVID-19 pandemic-related operational restrictions, which impacted visa processing. Despite these challenges, USCIS approved more employment-based adjustment of status applications in FY 2020 than in any of the previous 6 years. This trend continued through FY 2021, when USCIS approved what was at the time the second highest number of employment-based adjustment of status applications in the history of the agency. As described above, USCIS and DOS utilized all available employment-based immigrant visa numbers in FY 2022 and FY 2023.Q. Did DOS retrogress (set back) certain Final Action Dates or apply new Final Action Dates in the Visa Bulletin for October 2022?A. In the case of the October 2022 Visa Bulletin, without a retrogression of the Final Action Date for India EB-2, visa use by the two agencies would likely have exceeded the available visas within the first few weeks of the fiscal year, in violation of the statute. In setting the first Visa Bulletin of the fiscal year each October, DOS makes reasonable estimates of the available employment-based immigrant visas in each category. It then, in collaboration with USCIS, reviews the pending inventory of adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications, makes reasonable estimates of new applications, estimates how many of the pending and newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during the fiscal year, and compares those values to the available visas.When estimating how many pending or newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during a fiscal year, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to:The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them.When the amount of demand for a particular category (or a country within a category) exceeds the supply of visa numbers available, the category/country is considered “oversubscribed” and DOS applies a cut-off date in the Final Action Dates chart to ensure that visa use remains within the annual limits, as well as the category and per-country limits and order of consideration, as established by Congress. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. Why did DOS retrogress the India EB-3 Final Action Date in the July 2023 Visa Bulletin?A. DOS has answered this question in Item F of the July 2023 Visa Bulletin and in a further clarifying notice at Travel.State.Gov. (Added 06/16/2023)RetrogressionQ. Why do the dates in the Visa Bulletin sometimes retrogress?A. Congress explicitly directs DOS to “make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year within [the family-sponsored, employment-based and diversity categories] and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” See INA 203(g). DOS makes such estimates, and the Visa Bulletin reflects those “reasonable estimates.” However, these are estimates, and DOS, working collaboratively with USCIS, cannot know exactly how many individuals may ultimately apply for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa or have their applications approved. The demand for visas for adjustment of status depends on the response of aliens to the Visa Bulletin and the demand for immigrant visas depends on the response to the DOS Welcome Letter issued by the National Visa Center. Visa availability for a particular category or country can also change throughout the year through the fall up/fall down provisions (explained in the Allocation of Visa Numbers section on this page), through lower (or higher) use of family-sponsored visas (for example, by aliens chargeable to India or China), and through lower (or higher) than anticipated demand from applicants chargeable to countries other than India or China.This balancing act is a result of Congress allowing DOS to rely on “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued” while setting very strict and detailed annual limits and rules for the distribution of visas. Congress created a system in which DOS must regularly adjust the population of aliens who can potentially be issued visas (set by the Final Action Dates) in order to create sufficient demand for such visas (allowing the agencies the best chance to use all of the visas) while also restricting the issuance of such visas (to ensure that visa issuance remains within the limits established by Congress).When the demand for visas is higher than estimated and/or the availability of visas is lower than estimated, this may require retrogression of a Final Action Date to ensure that visa use remains within the limits established by Congress and that visas within a particular queue (based on category and country of chargeability) are generally allocated to those with the earliest priority dates as possible. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Why, as DOS noted in Part F of the August 2023 Visa Bulletin, do so many aliens chargeable to India have pending applications in the EB-1 category with older priority dates?A. It is common for aliens to have approved immigrant visa petitions in multiple categories, particularly when an alien faces a significant wait for an available visa. Over time, an alien may develop additional skills or qualifications that make them eligible to be the beneficiary of a petition in one of the EB-1 subcategories. Such aliens may decide to self-petition or have an employer file a petition on their behalf in EB-1, particularly if it would result in becoming an LPR much more quickly than in EB-2 or EB-3 visa categories. Under 8 CFR 204.5(e), an alien who is the beneficiary of multiple approved employment-based petitions in these categories may use the earliest priority date, with some exceptions. Many aliens from India with priority dates in 2012 through 2015 have pursued this option and as a result, the agencies’ pending inventory has a significant volume of such applications. (Added 07/14/2023)Q. Does retrogression affect my priority date or place in line for an immigrant visa?A. If an alien is seeking a visa in a preference category that required a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL), their priority date generally is the date DOL accepts the labor certification application for processing. For all other employment-based preference categories, the priority date generally is the date USCIS accepts the underlying petition for processing. Retrogression does not affect your priority date or your place in line for an immigrant visa. You may still receive a visa when one becomes available to you based on that priority date. Retrogression only means that due to the high demand for visas exceeding the statutory limits, visas are not available to all aliens who want them, even if they have already filed an application for adjustment of status.Q. My category retrogressed or a Final Action Date was applied. What is my path forward to a Green Card?A. When a visa becomes available to you in the future based on the Final Action Date for your country and category as compared to your priority date, USCIS will be able to approve your adjustment of status application if you are admissible, merit a favorable exercise of discretion, and are otherwise eligible. While your I-485 application for adjustment of status is pending, you are eligible to seek certain benefits, among which are:You may apply for employment authorization, which, if granted, is not tied to a particular employer, position, or job classification, and is currently granted in increments of up to 5 years;You may apply for advance parole, which, if granted, authorizes you to travel outside of the United States during the advance parole validity period (also now 5 years) and apply for parole into the United States upon your return (at a U.S. port of entry) without abandoning your adjustment of status application;If your employment-based adjustment of status application has been pending with USCIS for 180 days or more, you may request to “port” the underlying job opportunity upon which your adjustment is based to a new employer or new job offer that is the same or similar to the original one without the portability request alone impacting your priority date;Depending on the facts of your case, your children who have also applied for adjustment of status as your derivative beneficiaries might not age out of eligibility to adjust status as your derivative beneficiaries; andYou are generally considered to be “in a period of stay authorized” while your application is pending and would not accrue unlawful presence while “in a period of authorized stay.”Please note that USCIS is making every effort to reduce processing times for employment authorization and advance parole applications. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. If my adjustment of status application was approved, but then the Final Action Date for my category and country of chargeability later retrogresses, does that affect my status as a lawful permanent resident?A. Retrogression has no effect on lawful permanent residents. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Does retrogression affect consular processing?A. Yes. DOS and USCIS are only authorized to issue immigrant visa numbers (for purposes of consular processing or adjustment of status) if the applicant in the given family-sponsored or employment-based preference category has a priority date that is earlier than the date shown in the Final Action Dates chart of the Visa Bulletin for their country of chargeability and immigrant visa category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants). (Added 10/26/2022)Q. How does retrogression of the Final Action Dates affect eligibility for exemption from the 6-year limit on H-1B status?A. Under INA 214(g)(4), the period of “authorized admission” as an H-1B nonimmigrant “may not exceed 6 years.” However, there are certain exemptions to this limitation, including the exemption established by Congress in section 104(c) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act  (PDF) and codified in regulation in 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(E). Under that exemption, USCIS may grant additional periods in H-1B status in increments of up to 3 years for an alien who currently maintains or previously held H-1B status, who is the beneficiary of an approved EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 immigrant visa petition, and who is eligible to be granted lawful permanent resident (LPR) status (also known as obtaining a Green Card) in one of those categories but for the application of the per country limitation. If an applicant for adjustment of status is otherwise eligible for the exemption and does not have an immigrant visa available to them in EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 due to the application of the per-country limitations of INA 202(a)(2), USCIS may grant additional periods in H-1B status in increments of up to 3 years. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Does retrogression, the issuance of a Request for Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny, or the scheduling of an interview reset the 180-day portability clock?A. No. For more information about portability, please see Volume 7, Part E, Chapter 5 of the USCIS Policy Manual. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Do biometrics “expire” due to retrogression?A. No, the biometrics collected by USCIS in connection with a pending adjustment of status application never “expire.” While biometrics-based background checks are valid for a period of 15 months, USCIS refreshes the background check associated with the pending adjustment of status application by resubmitting the previously provided biometrics; a new biometrics appointment is not required. (Added 10/26/2022)Allocation of Visa NumbersQ. How are unused family-sponsored visa numbers from the previous fiscal year that are added to the employment-based limit in the current fiscal year distributed, given the per-country limits?A. Under INA 201(d)(2), the unused family-sponsored visa numbers from the previous fiscal year are added to the overall employment-based limit. Under INA 203(b), that overall employment-based limit is then divided between the 5 employment-based preference categories based on the fixed percentages as described above. However, within each employment-based category, the visas are still distributed with the per-country limits in effect, unless the exception to the per country limits of INA 202(a)(5) applies within that category. This exception is explained in detail in this section of the FAQ. The unused family-sponsored visa numbers added to the employment-based limit in the subsequent fiscal year are not automatically distributed to applicants with the earliest priority dates because the per-country limits still apply. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. If a category/country is “Current” in the Visa Bulletin, does that mean that there must be little or no inventory of pending applications with USCIS and DOS for that category/country?A. No. A category can be “Current” in the Visa Bulletin even when there are tens of thousands of applications pending with the agencies. “If there are sufficient [remaining visa] numbers in a particular category to satisfy all reported documentarily qualified demand, the category is considered ‘Current.’” See DOS’s The Operation of the Immigrant Numerical Control System  (PDF). For example, if EB-2 has 49,000 visas available for applicants from countries other than India and China, and there are 48,000 pending applications, then the category can be “Current.” (Added 10/26/2022)Q. If visas are “not required” in a particular employment-based category, are they made available in the other employment-based categories?A. Congress has established statutory provisions that allow for the flow of visas “not required” in certain employment-based categories to be made available to applicants in other employment-based categories. These are commonly referred to as the “fall up/fall down” provisions. Under INA 203(b), visas not required in EB-4 and unreserved visas not required in EB-5 are made available in EB-1. Visas not required in EB-1 are made available in EB-2, and visas not required in EB-2 are made available in EB-3. Congress did not create a pathway in the statute for visas not required in EB-3 to be made available in another employment-based category. Please note that with the enactment of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 on March 15, 2022, Congress established special rules for the carryover of certain unused EB-5 visas from one fiscal year to the next. As a result, not all EB-5 visas that are “not required” in that category can be made available in EB-1. DOS, in collaboration with USCIS, considers every month if visas may be “not required” in a particular employment-based category based on reasonable estimates, and sets the dates in the Visa Bulletin accordingly. This can happen as early as the first month in a fiscal year, depending on the underlying data. For example, in FY 2021 it was clear from the beginning of the fiscal year that a significant number of visas would not be “required” in EB-1 and the dates for EB-2 in the October 2020 Visa Bulletin reflected the reasonable estimate that visas would “fall down” to EB-2. As another example, in early FY 2022 it was clear that a significant number of visas would “fall up” from EB-5 to EB-1, and “fall down” from EB-1 to EB-2, and the dates in the Visa Bulletin reflected these reasonable estimates. Below is a visual representation of the “fall up/fall down” provisions. (Updated 03/22/2023)",

          "question": "Recent Developments",
          "answer": "Q. Can you estimate how many employment-based immigrant visas USCIS and the Department of State (DOS) used during FY 2024?A. DOS determined that the FY 2024 employment-based annual limit was 160,791, due to unused family-sponsored visa numbers from FY 2023 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2024. In addition to the 160,791 overall limit, there were 10,874  visas available in the EB-5 category that Congress allowed to carry over from the previous 2 fiscal years. Preliminary estimates indicate that the agencies used all the employment-based immigrant visas, apart from approximately 7,700 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over within the EB-5 category for the next fiscal year.(Updated 10/8/2024)Q.What information is available regarding how many pending Forms I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, USCIS currently has in its inventory in the employment-based categories by country of chargeability?A. We publish an inventory report,Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status - Pending Applications for Employment-Based Preference Categories, intended to provide information about the number of pending Forms I-485 in the employment-based preference categories. The report provides our estimate of how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory for each employment-based preference category, by selected country of chargeability, and by the month and year of the estimated priority date. An alien with a pending adjustment of status application can use the report to estimate how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory with earlier priority dates for their employment-based preference category and country of chargeability. Wait times for an employment-based immigrant visa depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, supply of visas and demand of visas for a particular preference category (at USCIS and the Department of State (DOS)), priority date, the country to which a visa will be charged (usually an applicant’s country of birth), and statutory limitations (for example, per country caps). The report does not include all those who may eventually be eligible for employment-based immigrant visas.How to Read This Report:This report provides an overview of the estimated volume of pending adjustment of status applications in the employment-based preference categories currently in the USCIS inventory. To determine how many adjustment of status applications in a particular category and country of chargeability have a priority date earlier than a given priority date, first find the sheet in the report with the relevant country of chargeability. Next, determine the relevant “Preference Category” and find the month and year of the priority date to see the volume of pending adjustment of status applications before that preference category and priority date. Every application on the report with a priority date that is earlier than the given priority date is ahead in the queue for adjustment of status.Please note, however, that this report does not contain information about DOS inventory, nor does it have any information about aliens with pending or approved immigrant visa petitions who have not yet applied for adjustment of status. Note also that this report reflects an estimate based on data available at the time the report was generated. The number of pending applications with older priority dates may change, not only as visas become available and applications are approved but also because of other factors, such as new Form I-485 applications based on older priority dates due to priority date retention or applications transferring from one basis to another (for example, an application transferring from a Form I-140 in the EB-3 category to a Form I-140 in the EB-2 category). This report also contains no information about pending applications for permanent labor certifications or prevailing wage determination requests at the Department of Labor. Therefore, it does not provide a complete picture of those in the queue for employment-based immigrant visas. (Added 05/14/2024)Q. How many employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and the Department of State (DOS) use during FY 2023?A. DOS determined that the FY 2023 employment-based annual limit was 197,091, due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2022 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2023. In addition, 6,396 EB-5 visas carried over from FY 2022 to FY 2023 in the reserved subcategories. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2023, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 10,874 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 147,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States.(Updated 03/07/2024)Q. Can the quarterly reports issued by USCIS or DHS be used to determine quarterly employment-based visa use?A. No. Our Immigration and Citizenship Data “All USCIS Application and Petition Form Types” and “Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485)”quarterly reportsdo not provide a comprehensive picture of employment-based visa use. The quarterly reports do not include the visas issued by our partners at DOS, and before FY 2023 they included the 4th preference employment-based categories under “other.” Thequarterly “Legal Immigration and Adjustment of Status”reports published by the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics include adjustments of status but capture immigrant admissions at ports of entry rather than immigrant visa issuance by DOS, and as a result do not reflect year-to-date visa use. Neither report can be used to determine the number of employment-based immigrant visas used during a quarter. Also, USCIS reminds the public that, as noted in theMonthly Immigrant Visa Issuance Statistics reportswebpage published by DOS, “individual monthly issuance reports should not be aggregated, as this will not provide an accurate issuance total for the fiscal year to date.”(Updated 10/8/2024)Q. How many family-sponsored or employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and DOS use during FY 2022?A. The Department of State (DOS) determined that the FY 2022 employment-based annual limit was 281,507 – more than double the typical annual total – due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2021 being allocated to the next fiscal year’s available employment-based visas. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 6,396 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 220,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for people already present in the United States.DOS determined that the FY 2022 family-sponsored annual limit was 226,000. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies had used 168,917 of the available visas. Of these, USCIS and EOIR approved more than 12,000 family-sponsored adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States. The approximately 57,000 unused family-sponsored visa numbers from FY 2022 are added to the FY 2023 employment-based limit.(Updated 03/22/2023)Q. Would you please summarize the changes we see in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin?A. With the start of fiscal year 2024, DOS can begin allocating employment-based visa numbers from the FY 2024 limit, estimated to be 161,000. As a result, we see a measure of recovery from the retrogressions of FY 2023 in all categories. Every Final Action Date in the Visa Bulletin has advanced from its level in September 2023 (or remained the same), and on Oct. 1, 2023, USCIS and DOS began completing the adjudication of applications filed by aliens for whom visas became available.(Updated 12/8/2023)Q. Why have the dates in some categories in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin not advanced sufficiently to allow new applications?A. USCIS and DOS have significant volumes of employment-based adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications in their inventories. For some categories, including EB-2 and EB-3 for aliens chargeable to India, the agencies already have sufficient applications on hand to use up all of the available visas for FY 2024 and several fiscal years in the future. INA 203 requires that DOS make “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year…and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” In addition, INA 245 requires, among other things, an immigrant visa to be “immediately available” at the time an application for adjustment of status is filed. Given these statutory provisions, when the agencies already have enough inventory to use several years’ supply of immigrant visas in a particular category, it is not reasonable to advance the dates in the Visa Bulletin to allow the filing of new applications.(Added 9/15/2023)Q. What does the October 2023 Visa Bulletin reveal about fiscal year 2024 and future fiscal years?A. As the agencies rebuild normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer unused family-based immigrant visa numbers are carrying over to increase the number of available employment-based immigrant visas in FY 2024. In the years ahead, once there are no more unused family-based numbers, the annual number of available employment-based immigrant visas should return to 140,000.This limit, established by Congress more than three decades ago, is insufficient to meet the demand for employment-based immigrant visas in every category. Barring a change to the statute or an unexpected reduction in aliens seeking employment-based immigrant visas, aliens from all countries can expect to see longer waits for immigrant visas.Within EB-1, the category remains “Current” for aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China and the Final Action Dates have advanced for both India and China compared to the September 2023 Visa Bulletin.Within EB-2, demand for visas from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China is so high that for the first time ever, the category is not “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of a fiscal year.The same is true in EB-3, where demand from countries other than India and China is very high and so the category will not be “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of the fiscal year for the first time since FY 2018. The Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to India and China in this category have advanced, reflecting the available visas for FY 2024.As has been true for the past few years, high demand in the EW (Other Worker) category from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China means that such aliens will still face a significant wait for visa availability.In EB-4, the Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to all countries has advanced.Visas will continue to be available to all aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China in the EB-5 category. Aliens chargeable to China will continue to benefit from the special statutory exception to the per-country levels in the EB-5 category, and this is reflected by the advancing dates in the Visa Bulletin. The dates for aliens chargeable to India in the EB-5 category have also advanced but the category is not “Current,” reflecting the fact that increased demand in the EB-5 category by such aliens is greater than the available supply of visas.(Added 9/15/2023)Q. With increasingly long waits for employment-based immigrant visas for aliens from every country and in most categories, what has USCIS done to help those affected?A. We are committed to working with Congress to find durable solutions to address the imbalance between the high demand for immigrant visas and the decades-old annual statutory limits. We continue to emphasize that this imbalance needs to be addressed and that only Congress can alleviate the statutory constraint on immigrant visa numbers.At the same time, we continue to pursue policy and regulatory changes to bring greater certainty, stability, and protection for employer-sponsored aliens (as well as self-petitioners, special immigrants and immigrant investors) in the United States. Recent such measures include:Establishinga 5-year validity period for employment authorization documents (EADs)  issued to aliens with pending adjustment of status applications, effective Sept. 27, 2023;Clarifyingeligibility criteria for O-1A and O-1B individuals of extraordinary ability;UpdatingUSCIS Policy Manual guidance regarding eligibility for the EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and Outstanding Professor or Researcher visa categories;Clarifyingeligibility for EB-2 individuals of exceptional ability and advanced degree holders with national interest waivers;Updatingthe USCIS interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to prevent some child beneficiaries from aging out of child status and allowing them to adjust immigration status with their parents;Clarifyingthe evidence required for physicians seeking a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement;Clarifyingeligibility criteria and standards for applications for compelling circumstances employment authorization documents (EADs);Clarifyingeligibility for J-1 exchange visitor status;Clarifyingoptions for workers whose employment has terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to remain in the United States while securing new employment;Updatingand expanding the list of degree fields qualifying alien graduates of U.S. universities for STEM optional practical training (OPT);Clarifyingthat USCIS considers certain E-1, E-2, E-3 and L-2 nonimmigrant dependent spouses employment authorized incident to status, such that they are not required to apply and wait for an EAD, and applying the automatic extension of employment authorization for renewal EAD applications filed by these E and L spouses as well as certain H-4 spouses;Establishinga process for healthcare and childcare workers to make an expedited request for processing of initial EAD applications that have been pending for more than 90 days, or renewal applications that would expire within 30 days or have already expired;Expandingpremium processing to all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, and certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, while adhering to the congressional requirement that such services must not cause an increase in processing times for regular immigration benefit requests;Launchinga new online form for individuals, attorneys, and accredited representatives to request an in-person appointment at their local field office without having to call the USCIS Contact Center.(Updated  12/8/2023)Q. How successful have the agencies been in using the available employment-based visas?A. For every fiscal year since FY 2007, with the exceptions of FY 2020 and FY 2021, USCIS and DOS have either used all of the available employment-based visas or fallen short by less than 1% of the annual limit. The 2-year period between FY 2020-2021 saw significantly higher than usual annual limits, and the shortfall of visa use in these fiscal years was caused by a shortage of financial resources and COVID-19 pandemic-related operational restrictions, which impacted visa processing. Despite these challenges, USCIS approved more employment-based adjustment of status applications in FY 2020 than in any of the previous 6 years. This trend continued through FY 2021, when USCIS approved what was at the time the second highest number of employment-based adjustment of status applications in the history of the agency. As described above, USCIS and DOS utilized all available employment-based immigrant visa numbers in FY 2022 and FY 2023.Q. Did DOS retrogress (set back) certain Final Action Dates or apply new Final Action Dates in the Visa Bulletin for October 2022?A. In the case of theOctober 2022 Visa Bulletin, without aretrogressionof the Final Action Date for India EB-2, visa use by the two agencies would likely have exceeded the available visas within the first few weeks of the fiscal year, in violation of the statute. In setting the first Visa Bulletin of the fiscal year each October, DOS makes reasonable estimates of the available employment-based immigrant visas in each category. It then, in collaboration with USCIS, reviews the pending inventory of adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications, makes reasonable estimates of new applications, estimates how many of the pending and newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during the fiscal year, and compares those values to the available visas.When estimating how many pending or newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during a fiscal year, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to:The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them.When the amount of demand for a particular category (or a country within a category) exceeds the supply of visa numbers available, the category/country is considered “oversubscribed” and DOS applies a cut-off date in the Final Action Dates chart to ensure that visa use remains within the annual limits, as well as the category and per-country limits and order of consideration, as established by Congress.(Updated 12/8/2023)Q.

          "answer": "A. DOS determined that the FY 2024 employment-based annual limit was 160,791, due to unused family-sponsored visa numbers from FY 2023 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2024. In addition to the 160,791 overall limit, there were 10,874  visas available in the EB-5 category that Congress allowed to carry over from the previous 2 fiscal years. Preliminary estimates indicate that the agencies used all the employment-based immigrant visas, apart from approximately 7,700 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over within the EB-5 category for the next fiscal year.(Updated 10/8/2024) Q.What information is available regarding how many pending Forms I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, USCIS currently has in its inventory in the employment-based categories by country of chargeability?"

          "answer": "A. DOS determined that the FY 2023 employment-based annual limit was 197,091, due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2022 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2023. In addition, 6,396 EB-5 visas carried over from FY 2022 to FY 2023 in the reserved subcategories. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2023, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 10,874 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 147,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States.(Updated 03/07/2024) Q. Can the quarterly reports issued by USCIS or DHS be used to determine quarterly employment-based visa use? A. No. Our Immigration and Citizenship Data “All USCIS Application and Petition Form Types” and “Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485)”quarterly reportsdo not provide a comprehensive picture of employment-based visa use. The quarterly reports do not include the visas issued by our partners at DOS, and before FY 2023 they included the 4th preference employment-based categories under “other.” Thequarterly “Legal Immigration and Adjustment of Status”reports published by the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics include adjustments of status but capture immigrant admissions at ports of entry rather than immigrant visa issuance by DOS, and as a result do not reflect year-to-date visa use. Neither report can be used to determine the number of employment-based immigrant visas used during a quarter. Also, USCIS reminds the public that, as noted in theMonthly Immigrant Visa Issuance Statistics reportswebpage published by DOS, “individual monthly issuance reports should not be aggregated, as this will not provide an accurate issuance total for the fiscal year to date.”(Updated 10/8/2024) Q. How many family-sponsored or employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and DOS use during FY 2022? A. The Department of State (DOS) determined that the FY 2022 employment-based annual limit was 281,507 – more than double the typical annual total – due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2021 being allocated to the next fiscal year’s available employment-based visas. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 6,396 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 220,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for people already present in the United States. DOS determined that the FY 2022 family-sponsored annual limit was 226,000. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies had used 168,917 of the available visas. Of these, USCIS and EOIR approved more than 12,000 family-sponsored adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States. The approximately 57,000 unused family-sponsored visa numbers from FY 2022 are added to the FY 2023 employment-based limit.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. Would you please summarize the changes we see in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin? A. With the start of fiscal year 2024, DOS can begin allocating employment-based visa numbers from the FY 2024 limit, estimated to be 161,000. As a result, we see a measure of recovery from the retrogressions of FY 2023 in all categories. Every Final Action Date in the Visa Bulletin has advanced from its level in September 2023 (or remained the same), and on Oct. 1, 2023, USCIS and DOS began completing the adjudication of applications filed by aliens for whom visas became available.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Why have the dates in some categories in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin not advanced sufficiently to allow new applications? A. USCIS and DOS have significant volumes of employment-based adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications in their inventories. For some categories, including EB-2 and EB-3 for aliens chargeable to India, the agencies already have sufficient applications on hand to use up all of the available visas for FY 2024 and several fiscal years in the future. INA 203 requires that DOS make “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year…and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” In addition, INA 245 requires, among other things, an immigrant visa to be “immediately available” at the time an application for adjustment of status is filed. Given these statutory provisions, when the agencies already have enough inventory to use several years’ supply of immigrant visas in a particular category, it is not reasonable to advance the dates in the Visa Bulletin to allow the filing of new applications.(Added 9/15/2023) Q. What does the October 2023 Visa Bulletin reveal about fiscal year 2024 and future fiscal years? A. As the agencies rebuild normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer unused family-based immigrant visa numbers are carrying over to increase the number of available employment-based immigrant visas in FY 2024. In the years ahead, once there are no more unused family-based numbers, the annual number of available employment-based immigrant visas should return to 140,000. This limit, established by Congress more than three decades ago, is insufficient to meet the demand for employment-based immigrant visas in every category. Barring a change to the statute or an unexpected reduction in aliens seeking employment-based immigrant visas, aliens from all countries can expect to see longer waits for immigrant visas. Within EB-1, the category remains “Current” for aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China and the Final Action Dates have advanced for both India and China compared to the September 2023 Visa Bulletin. Within EB-2, demand for visas from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China is so high that for the first time ever, the category is not “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of a fiscal year. The same is true in EB-3, where demand from countries other than India and China is very high and so the category will not be “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of the fiscal year for the first time since FY 2018. The Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to India and China in this category have advanced, reflecting the available visas for FY 2024. As has been true for the past few years, high demand in the EW (Other Worker) category from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China means that such aliens will still face a significant wait for visa availability. In EB-4, the Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to all countries has advanced. Visas will continue to be available to all aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China in the EB-5 category. Aliens chargeable to China will continue to benefit from the special statutory exception to the per-country levels in the EB-5 category, and this is reflected by the advancing dates in the Visa Bulletin. The dates for aliens chargeable to India in the EB-5 category have also advanced but the category is not “Current,” reflecting the fact that increased demand in the EB-5 category by such aliens is greater than the available supply of visas.(Added 9/15/2023) Q. With increasingly long waits for employment-based immigrant visas for aliens from every country and in most categories, what has USCIS done to help those affected? A. We are committed to working with Congress to find durable solutions to address the imbalance between the high demand for immigrant visas and the decades-old annual statutory limits. We continue to emphasize that this imbalance needs to be addressed and that only Congress can alleviate the statutory constraint on immigrant visa numbers. At the same time, we continue to pursue policy and regulatory changes to bring greater certainty, stability, and protection for employer-sponsored aliens (as well as self-petitioners, special immigrants and immigrant investors) in the United States. Recent such measures include: Establishinga 5-year validity period for employment authorization documents (EADs)  issued to aliens with pending adjustment of status applications, effective Sept. 27, 2023;Clarifyingeligibility criteria for O-1A and O-1B individuals of extraordinary ability;UpdatingUSCIS Policy Manual guidance regarding eligibility for the EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and Outstanding Professor or Researcher visa categories;Clarifyingeligibility for EB-2 individuals of exceptional ability and advanced degree holders with national interest waivers;Updatingthe USCIS interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to prevent some child beneficiaries from aging out of child status and allowing them to adjust immigration status with their parents;Clarifyingthe evidence required for physicians seeking a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement;Clarifyingeligibility criteria and standards for applications for compelling circumstances employment authorization documents (EADs);Clarifyingeligibility for J-1 exchange visitor status;Clarifyingoptions for workers whose employment has terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to remain in the United States while securing new employment;Updatingand expanding the list of degree fields qualifying alien graduates of U.S. universities for STEM optional practical training (OPT);Clarifyingthat USCIS considers certain E-1, E-2, E-3 and L-2 nonimmigrant dependent spouses employment authorized incident to status, such that they are not required to apply and wait for an EAD, and applying the automatic extension of employment authorization for renewal EAD applications filed by these E and L spouses as well as certain H-4 spouses;Establishinga process for healthcare and childcare workers to make an expedited request for processing of initial EAD applications that have been pending for more than 90 days, or renewal applications that would expire within 30 days or have already expired;Expandingpremium processing to all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, and certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, while adhering to the congressional requirement that such services must not cause an increase in processing times for regular immigration benefit requests;Launchinga new online form for individuals, attorneys, and accredited representatives to request an in-person appointment at their local field office without having to call the USCIS Contact Center.(Updated  12/8/2023) Q. How successful have the agencies been in using the available employment-based visas? A. For every fiscal year since FY 2007, with the exceptions of FY 2020 and FY 2021, USCIS and DOS have either used all of the available employment-based visas or fallen short by less than 1% of the annual limit. The 2-year period between FY 2020-2021 saw significantly higher than usual annual limits, and the shortfall of visa use in these fiscal years was caused by a shortage of financial resources and COVID-19 pandemic-related operational restrictions, which impacted visa processing. Despite these challenges, USCIS approved more employment-based adjustment of status applications in FY 2020 than in any of the previous 6 years. This trend continued through FY 2021, when USCIS approved what was at the time the second highest number of employment-based adjustment of status applications in the history of the agency. As described above, USCIS and DOS utilized all available employment-based immigrant visa numbers in FY 2022 and FY 2023. Q. Did DOS retrogress (set back) certain Final Action Dates or apply new Final Action Dates in the Visa Bulletin for October 2022? A. In the case of theOctober 2022 Visa Bulletin, without aretrogressionof the Final Action Date for India EB-2, visa use by the two agencies would likely have exceeded the available visas within the first few weeks of the fiscal year, in violation of the statute.

Within EB-1, the category remains “Current” for aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China and the Final Action Dates have advanced for both India and China compared to the September 2023 Visa Bulletin. Within EB-2, demand for visas from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China is so high that for the first time ever, the category is not “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of a fiscal year. The same is true in EB-3, where demand from countries other than India and China is very high and so the category will not be “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of the fiscal year for the first time since FY 2018. The Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to India and China in this category have advanced, reflecting the available visas for FY 2024. As has been true for the past few years, high demand in the EW (Other Worker) category from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China means that such aliens will still face a significant wait for visa availability. In EB-4, the Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to all countries has advanced. Visas will continue to be available to all aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China in the EB-5 category. Aliens chargeable to China will continue to benefit from the special statutory exception to the per-country levels in the EB-5 category, and this is reflected by the advancing dates in the Visa Bulletin. The dates for aliens chargeable to India in the EB-5 category have also advanced but the category is not “Current,” reflecting the fact that increased demand in the EB-5 category by such aliens is greater than the available supply of visas.(Added 9/15/2023) Q. With increasingly long waits for employment-based immigrant visas for aliens from every country and in most categories, what has USCIS done to help those affected? A. We are committed to working with Congress to find durable solutions to address the imbalance between the high demand for immigrant visas and the decades-old annual statutory limits. We continue to emphasize that this imbalance needs to be addressed and that only Congress can alleviate the statutory constraint on immigrant visa numbers. At the same time, we continue to pursue policy and regulatory changes to bring greater certainty, stability, and protection for employer-sponsored aliens (as well as self-petitioners, special immigrants and immigrant investors) in the United States. Recent such measures include: Establishinga 5-year validity period for employment authorization documents (EADs)  issued to aliens with pending adjustment of status applications, effective Sept. 27, 2023;Clarifyingeligibility criteria for O-1A and O-1B individuals of extraordinary ability;UpdatingUSCIS Policy Manual guidance regarding eligibility for the EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and Outstanding Professor or Researcher visa categories;Clarifyingeligibility for EB-2 individuals of exceptional ability and advanced degree holders with national interest waivers;Updatingthe USCIS interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to prevent some child beneficiaries from aging out of child status and allowing them to adjust immigration status with their parents;Clarifyingthe evidence required for physicians seeking a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement;Clarifyingeligibility criteria and standards for applications for compelling circumstances employment authorization documents (EADs);Clarifyingeligibility for J-1 exchange visitor status;Clarifyingoptions for workers whose employment has terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to remain in the United States while securing new employment;Updatingand expanding the list of degree fields qualifying alien graduates of U.S. universities for STEM optional practical training (OPT);Clarifyingthat USCIS considers certain E-1, E-2, E-3 and L-2 nonimmigrant dependent spouses employment authorized incident to status, such that they are not required to apply and wait for an EAD, and applying the automatic extension of employment authorization for renewal EAD applications filed by these E and L spouses as well as certain H-4 spouses;Establishinga process for healthcare and childcare workers to make an expedited request for processing of initial EAD applications that have been pending for more than 90 days, or renewal applications that would expire within 30 days or have already expired;Expandingpremium processing to all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, and certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, while adhering to the congressional requirement that such services must not cause an increase in processing times for regular immigration benefit requests;Launchinga new online form for individuals, attorneys, and accredited representatives to request an in-person appointment at their local field office without having to call the USCIS Contact Center.(Updated  12/8/2023) Q. How successful have the agencies been in using the available employment-based visas? A. For every fiscal year since FY 2007, with the exceptions of FY 2020 and FY 2021, USCIS and DOS have either used all of the available employment-based visas or fallen short by less than 1% of the annual limit. The 2-year period between FY 2020-2021 saw significantly higher than usual annual limits, and the shortfall of visa use in these fiscal years was caused by a shortage of financial resources and COVID-19 pandemic-related operational restrictions, which impacted visa processing. Despite these challenges, USCIS approved more employment-based adjustment of status applications in FY 2020 than in any of the previous 6 years. This trend continued through FY 2021, when USCIS approved what was at the time the second highest number of employment-based adjustment of status applications in the history of the agency. As described above, USCIS and DOS utilized all available employment-based immigrant visa numbers in FY 2022 and FY 2023. Q. Did DOS retrogress (set back) certain Final Action Dates or apply new Final Action Dates in the Visa Bulletin for October 2022? A. In the case of theOctober 2022 Visa Bulletin, without aretrogressionof the Final Action Date for India EB-2, visa use by the two agencies would likely have exceeded the available visas within the first few weeks of the fiscal year, in violation of the statute. In setting the first Visa Bulletin of the fiscal year each October, DOS makes reasonable estimates of the available employment-based immigrant visas in each category. It then, in collaboration with USCIS, reviews the pending inventory of adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications, makes reasonable estimates of new applications, estimates how many of the pending and newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during the fiscal year, and compares those values to the available visas. When estimating how many pending or newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during a fiscal year, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them. When the amount of demand for a particular category (or a country within a category) exceeds the supply of visa numbers available, the category/country is considered “oversubscribed” and DOS applies a cut-off date in the Final Action Dates chart to ensure that visa use remains within the annual limits, as well as the category and per-country limits and order of consideration, as established by Congress.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Why did DOS retrogress the India EB-3 Final Action Date in the July 2023 Visa Bulletin? A. DOS has answered this question in Item F of theJuly 2023 Visa Bulletinand in afurther clarifying noticeatTravel.State.Gov.(Added 06/16/2023)"

          "question": "Q. Would you please summarize the changes we see in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin?",
          "answer": "A. With the start of fiscal year 2024, DOS can begin allocating employment-based visa numbers from the FY 2024 limit, estimated to be 161,000. As a result, we see a measure of recovery from the retrogressions of FY 2023 in all categories. Every Final Action Date in the Visa Bulletin has advanced from its level in September 2023 (or remained the same), and on Oct. 1, 2023, USCIS and DOS began completing the adjudication of applications filed by aliens for whom visas became available.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Why have the dates in some categories in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin not advanced sufficiently to allow new applications? A. USCIS and DOS have significant volumes of employment-based adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications in their inventories. For some categories, including EB-2 and EB-3 for aliens chargeable to India, the agencies already have sufficient applications on hand to use up all of the available visas for FY 2024 and several fiscal years in the future. INA 203 requires that DOS make “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year…and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” In addition, INA 245 requires, among other things, an immigrant visa to be “immediately available” at the time an application for adjustment of status is filed. Given these statutory provisions, when the agencies already have enough inventory to use several years’ supply of immigrant visas in a particular category, it is not reasonable to advance the dates in the Visa Bulletin to allow the filing of new applications.(Added 9/15/2023) Q. What does the October 2023 Visa Bulletin reveal about fiscal year 2024 and future fiscal years? A. As the agencies rebuild normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer unused family-based immigrant visa numbers are carrying over to increase the number of available employment-based immigrant visas in FY 2024. In the years ahead, once there are no more unused family-based numbers, the annual number of available employment-based immigrant visas should return to 140,000. This limit, established by Congress more than three decades ago, is insufficient to meet the demand for employment-based immigrant visas in every category. Barring a change to the statute or an unexpected reduction in aliens seeking employment-based immigrant visas, aliens from all countries can expect to see longer waits for immigrant visas. Within EB-1, the category remains “Current” for aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China and the Final Action Dates have advanced for both India and China compared to the September 2023 Visa Bulletin. Within EB-2, demand for visas from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China is so high that for the first time ever, the category is not “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of a fiscal year. The same is true in EB-3, where demand from countries other than India and China is very high and so the category will not be “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of the fiscal year for the first time since FY 2018. The Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to India and China in this category have advanced, reflecting the available visas for FY 2024. As has been true for the past few years, high demand in the EW (Other Worker) category from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China means that such aliens will still face a significant wait for visa availability. In EB-4, the Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to all countries has advanced. Visas will continue to be available to all aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China in the EB-5 category. Aliens chargeable to China will continue to benefit from the special statutory exception to the per-country levels in the EB-5 category, and this is reflected by the advancing dates in the Visa Bulletin. The dates for aliens chargeable to India in the EB-5 category have also advanced but the category is not “Current,” reflecting the fact that increased demand in the EB-5 category by such aliens is greater than the available supply of visas.(Added 9/15/2023) Q.

It then, in collaboration with USCIS, reviews the pending inventory of adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications, makes reasonable estimates of new applications, estimates how many of the pending and newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during the fiscal year, and compares those values to the available visas. When estimating how many pending or newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during a fiscal year, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them. When the amount of demand for a particular category (or a country within a category) exceeds the supply of visa numbers available, the category/country is considered “oversubscribed” and DOS applies a cut-off date in the Final Action Dates chart to ensure that visa use remains within the annual limits, as well as the category and per-country limits and order of consideration, as established by Congress.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q.

          "question": "Q. With increasingly long waits for employment-based immigrant visas for aliens from every country and in most categories, what has USCIS done to help those affected?",
          "answer": "A. We are committed to working with Congress to find durable solutions to address the imbalance between the high demand for immigrant visas and the decades-old annual statutory limits. We continue to emphasize that this imbalance needs to be addressed and that only Congress can alleviate the statutory constraint on immigrant visa numbers. At the same time, we continue to pursue policy and regulatory changes to bring greater certainty, stability, and protection for employer-sponsored aliens (as well as self-petitioners, special immigrants and immigrant investors) in the United States. Recent such measures include: Establishinga 5-year validity period for employment authorization documents (EADs)  issued to aliens with pending adjustment of status applications, effective Sept. 27, 2023;Clarifyingeligibility criteria for O-1A and O-1B individuals of extraordinary ability;UpdatingUSCIS Policy Manual guidance regarding eligibility for the EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and Outstanding Professor or Researcher visa categories;Clarifyingeligibility for EB-2 individuals of exceptional ability and advanced degree holders with national interest waivers;Updatingthe USCIS interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to prevent some child beneficiaries from aging out of child status and allowing them to adjust immigration status with their parents;Clarifyingthe evidence required for physicians seeking a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement;Clarifyingeligibility criteria and standards for applications for compelling circumstances employment authorization documents (EADs);Clarifyingeligibility for J-1 exchange visitor status;Clarifyingoptions for workers whose employment has terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to remain in the United States while securing new employment;Updatingand expanding the list of degree fields qualifying alien graduates of U.S. universities for STEM optional practical training (OPT);Clarifyingthat USCIS considers certain E-1, E-2, E-3 and L-2 nonimmigrant dependent spouses employment authorized incident to status, such that they are not required to apply and wait for an EAD, and applying the automatic extension of employment authorization for renewal EAD applications filed by these E and L spouses as well as certain H-4 spouses;Establishinga process for healthcare and childcare workers to make an expedited request for processing of initial EAD applications that have been pending for more than 90 days, or renewal applications that would expire within 30 days or have already expired;Expandingpremium processing to all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, and certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, while adhering to the congressional requirement that such services must not cause an increase in processing times for regular immigration benefit requests;Launchinga new online form for individuals, attorneys, and accredited representatives to request an in-person appointment at their local field office without having to call the USCIS Contact Center.(Updated  12/8/2023) Q. How successful have the agencies been in using the available employment-based visas? A. For every fiscal year since FY 2007, with the exceptions of FY 2020 and FY 2021, USCIS and DOS have either used all of the available employment-based visas or fallen short by less than 1% of the annual limit. The 2-year period between FY 2020-2021 saw significantly higher than usual annual limits, and the shortfall of visa use in these fiscal years was caused by a shortage of financial resources and COVID-19 pandemic-related operational restrictions, which impacted visa processing. Despite these challenges, USCIS approved more employment-based adjustment of status applications in FY 2020 than in any of the previous 6 years. This trend continued through FY 2021, when USCIS approved what was at the time the second highest number of employment-based adjustment of status applications in the history of the agency. As described above, USCIS and DOS utilized all available employment-based immigrant visa numbers in FY 2022 and FY 2023. Q.

        },
        {
          "question": "Q. Why do the dates in the Visa Bulletin sometimes retrogress?",
          "answer": "A. Congress explicitly directs DOS to “make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year within [the family-sponsored, employment-based and diversity categories] and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” SeeINA 203(g). DOS makes such estimates, and the Visa Bulletin reflects those “reasonable estimates.” However, these are estimates, and DOS, working collaboratively with USCIS, cannot know exactly how many individuals may ultimately apply for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa or have their applications approved. The demand for visas for adjustment of status depends on the response of aliens to the Visa Bulletin and the demand for immigrant visas depends on the response to the DOS Welcome Letter issued by the National Visa Center. Visa availability for a particular category or country can also change throughout the year through the fall up/fall down provisions (explained in the Allocation of Visa Numbers section on this page), through lower (or higher) use of family-sponsored visas (for example, by aliens chargeable to India or China), and through lower (or higher) than anticipated demand from applicants chargeable to countries other than India or China. This balancing act is a result of Congress allowing DOS to rely on “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued” while setting very strict and detailed annual limits and rules for the distribution of visas. Congress created a system in which DOS must regularly adjust the population of aliens who can potentially be issued visas (set by the Final Action Dates) in order to create sufficient demand for such visas (allowing the agencies the best chance to use all of the visas) while also restricting the issuance of such visas (to ensure that visa issuance remains within the limits established by Congress). When the demand for visas is higher than estimated and/or the availability of visas is lower than estimated, this may require retrogression of a Final Action Date to ensure that visa use remains within the limits established by Congress and that visas within a particular queue (based on category and country of chargeability) are generally allocated to those with the earliest priority dates as possible.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. Why, as DOS noted in Part F of theAugust 2023 Visa Bulletin, do so many aliens chargeable to India have pending applications in the EB-1 category with older priority dates? A. It is common for aliens to have approved immigrant visa petitions in multiple categories, particularly when an alien faces a significant wait for an available visa. Over time, an alien may develop additional skills or qualifications that make them eligible to be the beneficiary of a petition in one of the EB-1 subcategories. Such aliens may decide to self-petition or have an employer file a petition on their behalf in EB-1, particularly if it would result in becoming an LPR much more quickly than in EB-2 or EB-3 visa categories. Under 8 CFR 204.5(e), an alien who is the beneficiary of multiple approved employment-based petitions in these categories may use the earliest priority date, with some exceptions. Many aliens from India with priority dates in 2012 through 2015 have pursued this option and as a result, the agencies’ pending inventory has a significant volume of such applications. (Added 07/14/2023) Q. Does retrogression affect my priority date or place in line for an immigrant visa? A. If an alien is seeking a visa in a preference category that required a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL), their priority date generally is the date DOL accepts the labor certification application for processing. For all other employment-based preference categories, the priority date generally is the date USCIS accepts the underlying petition for processing. Retrogression does not affect your priority date or your place in line for an immigrant visa. You may still receive a visa when one becomes available to you based on that priority date. Retrogression only means that due to the high demand for visas exceeding the statutory limits, visas are not available to all aliens who want them, even if they have already filed an application for adjustment of status. Q. My category retrogressed or a Final Action Date was applied. What is my path forward to a Green Card? A. When a visa becomes available to you in the future based on the Final Action Date for your country and category as compared to your priority date, USCIS will be able to approve your adjustment of status application if you are admissible, merit a favorable exercise of discretion, and are otherwise eligible. While your I-485 application for adjustment of status is pending, you are eligible to seek certain benefits, among which are: You may apply foremployment authorization, which, if granted, is not tied to a particular employer, position, or job classification, and is currently granted in increments of up to 5 years;You may apply foradvance parole, which, if granted, authorizes you to travel outside of the United States during the advance parole validity period (also now 5 years) and apply for parole into the United States upon your return (at a U.S. port of entry) without abandoning your adjustment of status application;If your employment-based adjustment of status application has been pending with USCIS for 180 days or more, you may request to “port” the underlying job opportunity upon which your adjustment is based to a new employer or new job offer that is the same or similar to the original one without the portability request alone impacting your priority date;Depending on the facts of your case, your children who have also applied for adjustment of status as your derivative beneficiaries might not age out ofeligibility to adjust statusas your derivative beneficiaries; andYou are generally considered to be “in a period of stay authorized” while your application is pending and would not accrue unlawful presence while “in a period of authorized stay.” Please note that USCIS is making every effort toreduce processing timesfor employment authorization and advance parole applications.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. If my adjustment of status application was approved, but then the Final Action Date for my category and country of chargeability later retrogresses, does that affect my status as a lawful permanent resident? A. Retrogression has no effect on lawful permanent residents.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. Does retrogression affect consular processing? A. Yes. DOS and USCIS are only authorized to issue immigrant visa numbers (for purposes of consular processing or adjustment of status) if the applicant in the given family-sponsored or employment-based preference category has a priority date that is earlier than the date shown in the Final Action Dates chart of the Visa Bulletin for their country of chargeability and immigrant visa category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants).(Added 10/26/2022) Q. How does retrogression of the Final Action Dates affect eligibility for exemption from the 6-year limit on H-1B status? A. UnderINA 214(g)(4), the period of “authorized admission” as an H-1B nonimmigrant “may not exceed 6 years.” However, there are certain exemptions to this limitation, including the exemption established by Congress insection 104(c) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act  (PDF)and codified in regulation in8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(E). Under that exemption, USCIS may grant additional periods in H-1B status in increments of up to 3 years for an alien who currently maintains or previously held H-1B status, who is the beneficiary of an approved EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 immigrant visa petition, and who is eligible to be granted lawful permanent resident (LPR) status (also known as obtaining a Green Card) in one of those categories but for the application of the per country limitation. If an applicant for adjustment of status is otherwise eligible for the exemption and does not have an immigrant visa available to them in EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 due to the application of the per-country limitations ofINA 202(a)(2), USCIS may grant additional periods in H-1B status in increments of up to 3 years.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. Does retrogression, the issuance of a Request for Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny, or the scheduling of an interview reset the 180-day portability clock? A. No. For more information about portability, please seeVolume 7, Part E, Chapter 5 of the USCIS Policy Manual.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. Do biometrics “expire” due to retrogression? A. No, the biometrics collected by USCIS in connection with a pending adjustment of status application never “expire.” While biometrics-based background checks are valid for a period of 15 months, USCIS refreshes the background check associated with the pending adjustment of status application by resubmitting the previously provided biometrics; a new biometrics appointment is not required.(Added 10/26/2022)"

          "answer": "A. When a visa becomes available to you in the future based on the Final Action Date for your country and category as compared to your priority date, USCIS will be able to approve your adjustment of status application if you are admissible, merit a favorable exercise of discretion, and are otherwise eligible. While your I-485 application for adjustment of status is pending, you are eligible to seek certain benefits, among which are: You may apply foremployment authorization, which, if granted, is not tied to a particular employer, position, or job classification, and is currently granted in increments of up to 5 years;You may apply foradvance parole, which, if granted, authorizes you to travel outside of the United States during the advance parole validity period (also now 5 years) and apply for parole into the United States upon your return (at a U.S. port of entry) without abandoning your adjustment of status application;If your employment-based adjustment of status application has been pending with USCIS for 180 days or more, you may request to “port” the underlying job opportunity upon which your adjustment is based to a new employer or new job offer that is the same or similar to the original one without the portability request alone impacting your priority date;Depending on the facts of your case, your children who have also applied for adjustment of status as your derivative beneficiaries might not age out ofeligibility to adjust statusas your derivative beneficiaries; andYou are generally considered to be “in a period of stay authorized” while your application is pending and would not accrue unlawful presence while “in a period of authorized stay.” Please note that USCIS is making every effort toreduce processing timesfor employment authorization and advance parole applications.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q.

UnderINA 203(b), that overall employment-based limit is then divided between the 5 employment-based preference categories based on the fixed percentages as described above. However, within each employment-based category, the visas are still distributed with the per-country limits in effect,unlessthe exception to the per country limits ofINA 202(a)(5)applies within that category. This exception is explained in detail in this section of the FAQ. The unused family-sponsored visa numbers added to the employment-based limit in the subsequent fiscal year are not automatically distributed to applicants with the earliest priority dates because the per-country limits still apply.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. If a category/country is “Current” in the Visa Bulletin, does that mean that there must be little or no inventory of pending applications with USCIS and DOS for that category/country? A. No. A category can be “Current” in the Visa Bulletin even when there are tens of thousands of applications pending with the agencies. “If there are sufficient [remaining visa] numbers in a particular category to satisfy all reported documentarily qualified demand, the category is considered ‘Current.’” See DOS’sThe Operation of the Immigrant Numerical Control System  (PDF). For example, if EB-2 has 49,000 visas available for applicants from countries other than India and China, and there are 48,000 pending applications, then the category can be “Current.”(Added 10/26/2022) Q. If visas are “not required” in a particular employment-based category, are they made available in the other employment-based categories? A. Congress has established statutory provisions that allow for the flow of visas “not required” in certain employment-based categories to be made available to applicants in other employment-based categories. These are commonly referred to as the “fall up/fall down” provisions. UnderINA 203(b), visas not required in EB-4 and unreserved visas not required in EB-5 are made available in EB-1. Visas not required in EB-1 are made available in EB-2, and visas not required in EB-2 are made available in EB-3. Congress did not create a pathway in the statute for visas not required in EB-3 to be made available in another employment-based category. Please note that with the enactment of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 on March 15, 2022, Congress established special rules for the carryover of certain unused EB-5 visas from one fiscal year to the next. As a result, not all EB-5 visas that are “not required” in that category can be made available in EB-1. DOS, in collaboration with USCIS, considers every month if visas may be “not required” in a particular employment-based category based on reasonable estimates, and sets the dates in the Visa Bulletin accordingly. This can happen as early as the first month in a fiscal year, depending on the underlying data. For example, in FY 2021 it was clear from the beginning of the fiscal year that a significant number of visas would not be “required” in EB-1 and the dates for EB-2 in the October 2020 Visa Bulletin reflected the reasonable estimate that visas would “fall down” to EB-2. As another example, in early FY 2022 it was clear that a significant number of visas would “fall up” from EB-5 to EB-1, and “fall down” from EB-1 to EB-2, and the dates in the Visa Bulletin reflected these reasonable estimates.

          "question": "Q. Why does USCIS not allow aliens to apply for adjustment of status based on the Dates for Filing chart every month of the year?",
          "answer": "A. When we determine that there are immigrant visas available for the filing of additional adjustment of status applications, aliens must use the Dates for Filing chart to determine when to file an adjustment of status application with USCIS. Otherwise, use the Final Action Dates chart to determine when to file an adjustment of status application with us. We make this determination monthly based on how many visa numbers remain available for the year, USCIS and DOS visa-available inventory, and operational considerations. Q. What is the “per-country limit”?  Does it apply to each employment-based preference category separately? UnderINA 202(a)(2), “the total number of immigrant visas made available to natives of any single foreign state…under subsections (a) and (b) of section 203 in any fiscal year may not exceed seven percent…of the total number of such visas made available under such subsections in that fiscal year.” Accordingly, there is a 7% annual per-country limit that applies to all the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories combined. The per-country limit only applies to aliens becoming lawful permanent residents in the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories under INA 203(a) and (b). Under the statute, the 7% per-country limit does not apply to each individual category and does not apply to the employment-based or family-sponsored visas on their own. For example, in FY 2023, the employment-based limit was 197,091 visas and the family-sponsored limit was 226,000 visas, added together for a total of 423,091 visas. Natives of a single foreign state could receive up to 7% of that total, or 29,616 visas in the employment-based and family-sponsored categories combined. If, in this example, DOS were to allocate 5,000 family-sponsored visas to natives of a single foreign state, then 24,616 employment-based visas would still be available to be allocated to natives of that foreign state, divided according to the usual statutory formula between the various employment-based categories. Currently, the countries that exceed the 7% per-country limit are China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines. INA 202(a)(5)(A) provides limited statutory exceptions to the per-country limit which can result in aliens from a single foreign state receiving more than 7% of the combined family-sponsored and employment-based limits (see details below). Please note that admission to the United States in other immigrant or nonimmigrant categories, parole into the United States, admission as a refugee, or any other manner of entering the United States have no impact on the per-country limit. (Updated 04/03/2024) Q. When does the special exception to the per-country levels for the employment-based categories apply? A. UnderINA 202(a)(5)(A),if the total number of visas available in one of the employment-based categories for a calendar quarter exceeds the number of qualified immigrants who may otherwise be issued such visas, the visas made available in that category will be issued without regard to the per-country numerical limitation. This can happen as early as the first day of a fiscal year, depending on the relevant data. USCIS understands that there are some misconceptions about this topic, and states again that this special exception to the per-country levels applies (if the statutory criteria are met) in any quarter of a fiscal year, not just in the fourth quarter. For example, in the October 2022 Visa Bulletin, EB-1 was “Current” for all countries of chargeability, indicating that the exception applies (based on reasonable estimates) and that visas in that category are being issued without regard to the per-country numerical limitation, benefitting applicants chargeable to India and China. Please note that if DOS has established a worldwide Final Action Date for an immigrant visa category, DOS has estimated that the total number of visas available in that category is less than the number of qualified immigrants who may otherwise use such visa numbers. For example, in the third and fourth quarters of FY 2023, DOS established a worldwide Final Action Date for EB-3. As a result, during those two quarters, the exception to the per-country limits did not apply in EB-3. (Updated 04/03/2024) Q. How do the agencies apply the quarterly limits to visa allocation in the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories? A.INA 201(a)(2)states that employment-based immigrants who may be issued immigrant visas or who may otherwise acquire LPR status are limited to 27% of the worldwide EB annual limit in each of the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. The quarterly limits do not apply to individual categories or countries; they apply to the use of all employment-based immigrant visas as a whole. For example, in the first quarter, the agencies could use 50% of the visas available in the EB-4 category, provided that overall use across all the EB categories did not exceed 27%. There is no quarterly allocation of visas for a specific country or category. As a result, there is no additional batch of visa numbers allocated to a particular country or category (for example, India EB-2) at the start of each quarter and the Final Action Dates established in the Visa Bulletin generally reflect the annual category and per-country limits. The same is true for the family-sponsored categories, as stated inINA 201(a)(1).(Added 03/22/2023) Q. When is a visa number subtracted from the annual limit? A. A visa number is subtracted from the annual limit when DOS issues an immigrant visa to an alien through consular processing or when an alien acquires lawful permanent resident status upon approval of their application for adjustment of status, either with USCIS or EOIR of the U.S. Department of Justice. A visa number is not subtracted from the annual limit based on any other preliminary step in the adjudication process (that is, not at the time of filing, not at the time of interview scheduling, not at the time of transferring to a USCIS field office, not with the issuance of a Request for Evidence, not with the approval of the underlying immigrant visa petition, not with the granting of a transfer of underlying basis request, etc.). There is also no reservation or pre-allocation of a visa number to an applicant at any of these procedural steps. If USCIS has approved an adjustment of status application for a principal applicant, but the applications of dependent family members remain pending, immigrant visa numbers have not yet been subtracted from the annual limit for the dependent family members.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. What is cross-chargeability and how does USCIS apply it? A. In certain situations, an applicant may benefit from the charging of their visa number to their spouse’s or parent’s country of birth rather than their own. This is known as cross-chargeability, and is found inINA 202(b). In practice, cross-chargeability is used where the preference quota category is backlogged for one spouse’s country of chargeability but a visa is available for the other spouse’s country of chargeability. The principal applicant may cross-charge to the derivative spouse’s country, and the derivative spouse may cross-charge to the principal’s country. Derivative children may cross-charge to either parent’s country as necessary. Parents may not cross-charge to a child’s country. In other words, the principal applicant or derivative spouse may never use their child’s country of birth for cross-chargeability. Whenever possible, USCIS applies cross-chargeability to preserve family unity and allow family members to immigrate together. For more information, please see theUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 7, Part A, Chapter 6.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. When USCIS uses the phrase “visa available” when referring to pending applications for adjustment of status, what does this mean? A. When USCIS uses the phrase “visa available” in reference to a pending adjustment of status application, it means that the applicant in the given family-sponsored or employment-based preference category has a priority date that is earlier than the date shown in the Final Action Dates chart of the Visa Bulletin for their country of chargeability and immigrant visa category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants). Please note that just because a visa is available for issuance to an applicant does not mean that the applicant has been allocated a visa.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. How does USCIS determine if an immigrant visa is “immediately available” when considering whether to accept or reject an adjustment of status application? A. Under the regulations, an immigrant visa in the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories “is considered available for accepting and processing” the adjustment of status application “if the applicant has a priority date…which is earlier than the date shown in the [Visa] Bulletin” for their country and category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants). See8 CFR 245.1(g)(1). To make this determination, USCIS consults the appropriate chart in the Visa Bulletin (Final Action Dates or Dates for Filing) for the month when the application was received at the correct USCIS filing location per the form instructions. USCIS posts which charts may be used on itsAdjustment of Status Filing Charts from the Visa Bulletin. Only the publication of a revised Visa Bulletin for a month would alter USCIS’ decision about accepting or rejecting an application due to visa availability. Please note that accepting or rejecting a benefit request is part of USCIS intake processing; it is not the approval or denial of the benefit request by an adjudicator.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. What is the difference between the Dates for Filing chart and the Final Action Dates chart? A. The Final Action Dates charts indicate when an applicant may be scheduled for a consular interview and when their case may be processed to completion by DOS or USCIS. Immigrant visa numbers can be authorized for issuance only for an applicant whose priority date is earlier than the Final Action Date for their category and country of chargeability (or the category is Current). The Dates for Filing charts indicate when an application is within a timeframe justifying immediate action in the application process. Applicants for immigrant visas who have a priority date earlier than the Date for Filing for their category and country of chargeability (or the category is Current) may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center, following receipt of notification from the National Visa Center containing detailed instructions. For aliens interested in pursuing adjustment of status, USCIS may allow them to apply for adjustment based on the Dates for Filing chart.  This is a monthly determination. and we announce this on ourwebsite.(Added 9/15/2023)"

          "question": "Q. What is the “per-country limit”?  Does it apply to each employment-based preference category separately?",
          "answer": "UnderINA 202(a)(2), “the total number of immigrant visas made available to natives of any single foreign state…under subsections (a) and (b) of section 203 in any fiscal year may not exceed seven percent…of the total number of such visas made available under such subsections in that fiscal year.” Accordingly, there is a 7% annual per-country limit that applies to all the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories combined. The per-country limit only applies to aliens becoming lawful permanent residents in the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories under INA 203(a) and (b). Under the statute, the 7% per-country limit does not apply to each individual category and does not apply to the employment-based or family-sponsored visas on their own. For example, in FY 2023, the employment-based limit was 197,091 visas and the family-sponsored limit was 226,000 visas, added together for a total of 423,091 visas. Natives of a single foreign state could receive up to 7% of that total, or 29,616 visas in the employment-based and family-sponsored categories combined. If, in this example, DOS were to allocate 5,000 family-sponsored visas to natives of a single foreign state, then 24,616 employment-based visas would still be available to be allocated to natives of that foreign state, divided according to the usual statutory formula between the various employment-based categories. Currently, the countries that exceed the 7% per-country limit are China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines. INA 202(a)(5)(A) provides limited statutory exceptions to the per-country limit which can result in aliens from a single foreign state receiving more than 7% of the combined family-sponsored and employment-based limits (see details below). Please note that admission to the United States in other immigrant or nonimmigrant categories, parole into the United States, admission as a refugee, or any other manner of entering the United States have no impact on the per-country limit. (Updated 04/03/2024) Q. When does the special exception to the per-country levels for the employment-based categories apply? A. UnderINA 202(a)(5)(A),if the total number of visas available in one of the employment-based categories for a calendar quarter exceeds the number of qualified immigrants who may otherwise be issued such visas, the visas made available in that category will be issued without regard to the per-country numerical limitation. This can happen as early as the first day of a fiscal year, depending on the relevant data. USCIS understands that there are some misconceptions about this topic, and states again that this special exception to the per-country levels applies (if the statutory criteria are met) in any quarter of a fiscal year, not just in the fourth quarter. For example, in the October 2022 Visa Bulletin, EB-1 was “Current” for all countries of chargeability, indicating that the exception applies (based on reasonable estimates) and that visas in that category are being issued without regard to the per-country numerical limitation, benefitting applicants chargeable to India and China. Please note that if DOS has established a worldwide Final Action Date for an immigrant visa category, DOS has estimated that the total number of visas available in that category is less than the number of qualified immigrants who may otherwise use such visa numbers. For example, in the third and fourth quarters of FY 2023, DOS established a worldwide Final Action Date for EB-3. As a result, during those two quarters, the exception to the per-country limits did not apply in EB-3. (Updated 04/03/2024) Q. How do the agencies apply the quarterly limits to visa allocation in the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories? A.INA 201(a)(2)states that employment-based immigrants who may be issued immigrant visas or who may otherwise acquire LPR status are limited to 27% of the worldwide EB annual limit in each of the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. The quarterly limits do not apply to individual categories or countries; they apply to the use of all employment-based immigrant visas as a whole. For example, in the first quarter, the agencies could use 50% of the visas available in the EB-4 category, provided that overall use across all the EB categories did not exceed 27%. There is no quarterly allocation of visas for a specific country or category. As a result, there is no additional batch of visa numbers allocated to a particular country or category (for example, India EB-2) at the start of each quarter and the Final Action Dates established in the Visa Bulletin generally reflect the annual category and per-country limits. The same is true for the family-sponsored categories, as stated inINA 201(a)(1).(Added 03/22/2023) Q. When is a visa number subtracted from the annual limit? A. A visa number is subtracted from the annual limit when DOS issues an immigrant visa to an alien through consular processing or when an alien acquires lawful permanent resident status upon approval of their application for adjustment of status, either with USCIS or EOIR of the U.S. Department of Justice. A visa number is not subtracted from the annual limit based on any other preliminary step in the adjudication process (that is, not at the time of filing, not at the time of interview scheduling, not at the time of transferring to a USCIS field office, not with the issuance of a Request for Evidence, not with the approval of the underlying immigrant visa petition, not with the granting of a transfer of underlying basis request, etc.). There is also no reservation or pre-allocation of a visa number to an applicant at any of these procedural steps. If USCIS has approved an adjustment of status application for a principal applicant, but the applications of dependent family members remain pending, immigrant visa numbers have not yet been subtracted from the annual limit for the dependent family members.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. What is cross-chargeability and how does USCIS apply it? A. In certain situations, an applicant may benefit from the charging of their visa number to their spouse’s or parent’s country of birth rather than their own. This is known as cross-chargeability, and is found inINA 202(b). In practice, cross-chargeability is used where the preference quota category is backlogged for one spouse’s country of chargeability but a visa is available for the other spouse’s country of chargeability. The principal applicant may cross-charge to the derivative spouse’s country, and the derivative spouse may cross-charge to the principal’s country. Derivative children may cross-charge to either parent’s country as necessary. Parents may not cross-charge to a child’s country. In other words, the principal applicant or derivative spouse may never use their child’s country of birth for cross-chargeability. Whenever possible, USCIS applies cross-chargeability to preserve family unity and allow family members to immigrate together. For more information, please see theUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 7, Part A, Chapter 6.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. When USCIS uses the phrase “visa available” when referring to pending applications for adjustment of status, what does this mean? A. When USCIS uses the phrase “visa available” in reference to a pending adjustment of status application, it means that the applicant in the given family-sponsored or employment-based preference category has a priority date that is earlier than the date shown in the Final Action Dates chart of the Visa Bulletin for their country of chargeability and immigrant visa category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants).

What is the difference between the Dates for Filing chart and the Final Action Dates chart? A. The Final Action Dates charts indicate when an applicant may be scheduled for a consular interview and when their case may be processed to completion by DOS or USCIS. Immigrant visa numbers can be authorized for issuance only for an applicant whose priority date is earlier than the Final Action Date for their category and country of chargeability (or the category is Current). The Dates for Filing charts indicate when an application is within a timeframe justifying immediate action in the application process. Applicants for immigrant visas who have a priority date earlier than the Date for Filing for their category and country of chargeability (or the category is Current) may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center, following receipt of notification from the National Visa Center containing detailed instructions.

When USCIS uses the phrase “visa available” in reference to a pending adjustment of status application, it means that the applicant in the given family-sponsored or employment-based preference category has a priority date that is earlier than the date shown in the Final Action Dates chart of the Visa Bulletin for their country of chargeability and immigrant visa category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants). Please note that just because a visa is available for issuance to an applicant does not mean that the applicant has been allocated a visa.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. How does USCIS determine if an immigrant visa is “immediately available” when considering whether to accept or reject an adjustment of status application? A. Under the regulations, an immigrant visa in the family-sponsored and employment-based preference categories “is considered available for accepting and processing” the adjustment of status application “if the applicant has a priority date…which is earlier than the date shown in the [Visa] Bulletin” for their country and category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants). See8 CFR 245.1(g)(1). To make this determination, USCIS consults the appropriate chart in the Visa Bulletin (Final Action Dates or Dates for Filing) for the month when the application was received at the correct USCIS filing location per the form instructions. USCIS posts which charts may be used on itsAdjustment of Status Filing Charts from the Visa Bulletin. Only the publication of a revised Visa Bulletin for a month would alter USCIS’ decision about accepting or rejecting an application due to visa availability. Please note that accepting or rejecting a benefit request is part of USCIS intake processing; it is not the approval or denial of the benefit request by an adjudicator.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. What is the difference between the Dates for Filing chart and the Final Action Dates chart? A. The Final Action Dates charts indicate when an applicant may be scheduled for a consular interview and when their case may be processed to completion by DOS or USCIS. Immigrant visa numbers can be authorized for issuance only for an applicant whose priority date is earlier than the Final Action Date for their category and country of chargeability (or the category is Current). The Dates for Filing charts indicate when an application is within a timeframe justifying immediate action in the application process. Applicants for immigrant visas who have a priority date earlier than the Date for Filing for their category and country of chargeability (or the category is Current) may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center, following receipt of notification from the National Visa Center containing detailed instructions. For aliens interested in pursuing adjustment of status, USCIS may allow them to apply for adjustment based on the Dates for Filing chart.  This is a monthly determination. and we announce this on ourwebsite.(Added 9/15/2023)"

          "question": "Q. When is a derivative child’s applicant age locked under the Child Status Protection Act, and how is that age calculated?",
          "answer": "A. In the employment-based preference categories, a child’s age under theChild Status Protection Act (CSPA)is the child’s biological age at the time of visa availability less the amount of time that the underlying petition was pending, but only if the child sought to acquire status as a lawful permanent resident within one year of the date a visa is available. For more information about when a visa is considered available for CSPA purposes, as well as other details about CSPA, please seeVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 7 of the USCIS Policy Manual. Q. When USCIS adjudicates a principal applicant’s adjustment of status application, does USCIS also adjudicate the adjustment of status applications of the dependent family members? What if dependent family members are not approved before priority dates move back? A. USCIS makes every effort to adjudicate the principal and derivative family members at the same time, but this is not always possible. Two things that applicants can do to help USCIS adjudicate a family’s applications together are: Providing as much of the information requested in the section of Form I-485 titled “Information About Your Immigrant Category” as possible; andEnsuring that all applications include the required evidence for each family member. If we deem approvable a Form I-485 of a derivative family member and a visa number is not available based on the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin at the time we make that determination, the application will remain pending until a visa number is available, DOS allocates a visa, and USCIS completes the adjudication. Please note that whenINA 203(d)states that a derivative family member “shall…be entitled to the same status, and the same order of consideration…if accompanying or following to join” the principal applicant, it means that a derivative has the same priority date (order of consideration) and same immigrant visa category as the principal applicant. It does not mean that the derivative spouse or child always receives a visa or adjusts status on the same date as the principal applicant. This is clear from the language about “accompanying or following to join,” which allows a derivative to receive an immigrant visa or adjust status after the principal applicant. For more information about derivative applicants and “accompanying or following to join,” please seeVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 6 of the USCIS Policy Manual.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. If I applied for adjustment of status as a principal applicant, and my spouse applied as my dependent family member, but now visas are unavailable for us based on my petition but they are available based on a petition filed for my spouse, may we transfer our pending adjustment of status applications to her petition? A. Yes. In a situation like this, where both spouses have one or more petitions that could serve as the underlying basis for their adjustment of status applications, they can request to transfer the underlying basis from a petition filed on behalf of one spouse to a petition filed on behalf of the other if the new immigrant visa category allows for dependent spouses. For example, the couple could not transfer to a petition filed in an immediate relative category where dependents are not permitted under the statute. This is different from cross-chargeability, which is when an applicant may benefit from the charging of their visa number to their spouse’s or parent’s country of birth rather than their own. For more information about cross-chargeability, please see the Allocation of Visa Numbers section on this page.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. If I applied for adjustment of status as a principal applicant but my spouse or children did not apply at the same time as I did, may they apply for adjustment of status in the future? A. Yes, if they are otherwise eligible. Derivative family members may accompany or follow to join a principal applicant and may apply for adjustment of status (or an immigrant visa) while the principal applicant’s application is pending or after the principal applicant has become an LPR. However, the derivative family member must meet the eligibility requirements to file for adjustment of status, including that an immigrant visa is immediately available to them at the time they file their application. As a result, if a visa is no longer available to the family member due to retrogression or the application of a Final Action Date, they must wait for a visa to again become available before they are eligible for adjustment of status. If the principal beneficiary becomes an LPR and loses their LPR status or naturalizes before the derivative family member’s adjustment of status, the derivative is no longer eligible for the classification as an accompanying or following-to-join family member. A family member may be eligible for LPR status as the spouse, child, or adult son or daughter of a U.S. citizen.(Added 9/15/2023)"

          "question": "Q. What is a transfer of the underlying basis of an adjustment of status application?",
          "answer": "A. An adjustment of status applicant whose application is based on a particular immigrant category occasionally prefers to have the pending application considered under another category. For example, an applicant who applied for adjustment of status concurrently with an employment-based petition in one preference category may want to transfer the underlying basis of their Form I-485 to a new employment-based petition filed by a different employer in a different preference category. There is no fee associated with submitting a request to transfer the underlying basis of your Form I-485, and you do not have to submit a new adjustment of status application with your transfer request. You may also transfer the underlying basis of your Form I-485 from the new petition back to your original petition, or to another petition, by submitting a new transfer request. For more information about transferring the underlying basis of your adjustment of status application, seeVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 8 of the USCIS Policy Manual.(Added 03/22/2023) Q. How does the transfer of underlying basis request process work? A. We have created a centralized location for the receipt of transfer of underlying basis requests between the employment-based preference categories that are accompanied by a Form I-485 Supplement J. You may submit your written request and completed Supplement J to: U.S. Postal Service (USPS): USCISAttn: Supp JPO Box 660834Dallas, TX 75266-0834 FedEx, UPS, and DHL deliveries: USCISAttn: Supp J (Box 660834)2501 S. State Hwy. 121 BusinessSuite 400Lewisville, TX 75067-8003 You should only send transfer requests accompanied by a Supplement J to this address. Do not send other forms, documents, or evidence to this address. Employment-based transfer requests that are not accompanied by a Supplement J should be submitted in writing to the USCIS office with jurisdiction over your pending I-485 application. If you have already submitted a transfer request to a USCIS office, you should not submit a new request. All requests to transfer the underlying basis already received or that will be received at a USCIS office will be processed as usual by the USCIS office with jurisdiction over your pending Form I-485. For transfer requests accompanied by Supplement J submitted to this address at the Dallas Lockbox, we scan the documents, upload the Supplement J information into our systems (generating a receipt notice), and notify the office or service center that currently holds the related adjustment of status application that the scanned request is available in our electronic systems. A USCIS officer reviews the transfer request and will grant or deny the request as a part of the adjudication of the adjustment of status application. A receipt notice does not mean that USCIS has granted the transfer request, it just indicates that USCIS has uploaded the Supplement J information into our systems. USCIS does not notify the applicant when it grants a transfer request.(Updated 10/26/2022) Q. How does a transfer of underlying basis request affect the calculation of a child’s age under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA)? A. As stated inVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 7 of the USCIS Policy Manual, “[i]f an applicant has multiple approved petitions, the applicant’s CSPA age is calculated using the petition that forms the underlying basis for the adjustment of status application.\" When we approve a request to transfer the underlying basis of the pending adjustment of status application, we calculate the CSPA age using the approved petition that forms the new basis of the adjustment application. If we transfer an applicant’s underlying basis, then we calculate an eligible applicant’s CSPA age using the applicant’s age at the time the immigrant visa becomes available in the new category minus the time the immigrant petition that forms the new basis of the adjustment of status application was pending.(Updated 03/22/23) Q. If the immigrant visa petition underlying my pending adjustment of status application has not been adjudicated, will this prevent me from transferring the basis to a different petition? A. No. If you have a pending petition, that does not prevent us from granting a request to transfer the underlying basis of your pending Form I-485 to a different Form I-140. Q. Why must applicants request to transfer the underlying basis of their pending Form I-485? Why does USCIS not review its records and make the decision for the applicants? A. The decision to grant a transfer request is made in the discretion of USCIS. If we grant the transfer request, we will adjudicate the Form I-485 application based on the petition to which the Form I-485 was transferred. If we do not grant the transfer request, we will adjudicate the Form I-485 application based on the petition associated with the Form I-485 application prior to the transfer request. We do not presume to know whether an adjustment of status applicant would like to transfer their pending Form I-485 application from the petition on which it is currently based to a different petition. We require transfer requests to be in writing from the applicant to ensure that the record accurately reflects the basis on which the applicant requests us to adjudicate the adjustment of status application. To highlight the importance of applicants making this decision themselves and communicating it to us, here is an example. Consider an alien with a pending Form I-485 who does not have an available visa based on the underlying petition. They have an older approved petition in a different preference category where a visa is available to them. However, the petition was filed over 10 years ago, and the alien no longer has a relationship with the potential employer, or the employer may no longer exist or no longer be willing to employ the alien. As a result, the alien could not adjust status based on that petition. Q. What happens when an EB-3 I-140 downgraded petition is pending and attached to a still-pending Form I-485? Is it true that the EB-3 I-140 does not have to be approved to allow a transfer of underlying basis of the Form I-485 to an approved EB-2 I-140 where the EB-2 priority date is earlier than the Final Action Date for the relevant category and country of chargeability? A. A pending EB-3 petition in this scenario does not prevent USCIS from granting the applicant’s request to transfer the underlying basis of their pending Form I-485 to a separate, approved Form I-140. Q. If USCIS has granted my transfer of underlying basis request, does it mean that an immigrant visa has been allocated to me? A. No, USCIS granting an applicant’s transfer of underlying basis request does not mean that an immigrant visa has been allocated to the applicant. For more information about transfer of underlying basis, please seeVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 8 of the USCIS Policy Manual.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. If USCIS grants my transfer of underlying basis request, will USCIS consider my eligibility for adjustment of status on both bases? For example, if I applied for adjustment of status based on an EB-3 petition and USCIS granted my transfer request to an EB-2 petition, will USCIS consider my eligibility on either petition? A. No, if USCIS grants an applicant’s transfer of underlying basis request, USCIS will only adjudicate the adjustment of status application on the most recently granted transfer request. If an employment-based adjustment of status applicant wants to transfer to another basis, they must submit a new transfer request. In this example, USCIS would only consider the applicant’s eligibility for adjustment on the basis of the EB-2 petition, unless the applicant again requested a transfer to a third basis.(Added 10/26/2022)"

If the immigrant visa petition underlying my pending adjustment of status application has not been adjudicated, will this prevent me from transferring the basis to a different petition? A. No. If you have a pending petition, that does not prevent us from granting a request to transfer the underlying basis of your pending Form I-485 to a different Form I-140. Q. Why must applicants request to transfer the underlying basis of their pending Form I-485? Why does USCIS not review its records and make the decision for the applicants? A. The decision to grant a transfer request is made in the discretion of USCIS. If we grant the transfer request, we will adjudicate the Form I-485 application based on the petition to which the Form I-485 was transferred. If we do not grant the transfer request, we will adjudicate the Form I-485 application based on the petition associated with the Form I-485 application prior to the transfer request. We do not presume to know whether an adjustment of status applicant would like to transfer their pending Form I-485 application from the petition on which it is currently based to a different petition. We require transfer requests to be in writing from the applicant to ensure that the record accurately reflects the basis on which the applicant requests us to adjudicate the adjustment of status application. To highlight the importance of applicants making this decision themselves and communicating it to us, here is an example. Consider an alien with a pending Form I-485 who does not have an available visa based on the underlying petition. They have an older approved petition in a different preference category where a visa is available to them. However, the petition was filed over 10 years ago, and the alien no longer has a relationship with the potential employer, or the employer may no longer exist or no longer be willing to employ the alien. As a result, the alien could not adjust status based on that petition. Q. What happens when an EB-3 I-140 downgraded petition is pending and attached to a still-pending Form I-485? Is it true that the EB-3 I-140 does not have to be approved to allow a transfer of underlying basis of the Form I-485 to an approved EB-2 I-140 where the EB-2 priority date is earlier than the Final Action Date for the relevant category and country of chargeability? A. A pending EB-3 petition in this scenario does not prevent USCIS from granting the applicant’s request to transfer the underlying basis of their pending Form I-485 to a separate, approved Form I-140. Q. If USCIS has granted my transfer of underlying basis request, does it mean that an immigrant visa has been allocated to me? A. No, USCIS granting an applicant’s transfer of underlying basis request does not mean that an immigrant visa has been allocated to the applicant.

If USCIS grants my transfer of underlying basis request, will USCIS consider my eligibility for adjustment of status on both bases? For example, if I applied for adjustment of status based on an EB-3 petition and USCIS granted my transfer request to an EB-2 petition, will USCIS consider my eligibility on either petition? A. No, if USCIS grants an applicant’s transfer of underlying basis request, USCIS will only adjudicate the adjustment of status application on the most recently granted transfer request. If an employment-based adjustment of status applicant wants to transfer to another basis, they must submit a new transfer request. In this example, USCIS would only consider the applicant’s eligibility for adjustment on the basis of the EB-2 petition, unless the applicant again requested a transfer to a third basis.(Added 10/26/2022)"

          "question": "Q. How does a transfer of underlying basis request affect the calculation of a child’s age under the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA)?",
          "answer": "A. As stated inVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 7 of the USCIS Policy Manual, “[i]f an applicant has multiple approved petitions, the applicant’s CSPA age is calculated using the petition that forms the underlying basis for the adjustment of status application.\" When we approve a request to transfer the underlying basis of the pending adjustment of status application, we calculate the CSPA age using the approved petition that forms the new basis of the adjustment application. If we transfer an applicant’s underlying basis, then we calculate an eligible applicant’s CSPA age using the applicant’s age at the time the immigrant visa becomes available in the new category minus the time the immigrant petition that forms the new basis of the adjustment of status application was pending.(Updated 03/22/23) Q. If the immigrant visa petition underlying my pending adjustment of status application has not been adjudicated, will this prevent me from transferring the basis to a different petition? A. No. If you have a pending petition, that does not prevent us from granting a request to transfer the underlying basis of your pending Form I-485 to a different Form I-140. Q. Why must applicants request to transfer the underlying basis of their pending Form I-485? Why does USCIS not review its records and make the decision for the applicants? A.

          "answer": "A. USCIS strongly encourages adjustment of status applicants to submit Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, with their Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. Doing so will help limit the need for USCIS to send Requests for Evidence, reduce processing times, and aid USCIS as it works with DOS to use all available visas. (Updated 12/8/2023) Q. If I did not file a Form I-693 with my pending Form I-485, should I send one in now or wait for USCIS to request it, and why? A. Aliens with pending adjustment of status applications should not send an unsolicitedForm I-693to us. Given the rapid movement of files between directorates and offices as we strive to optimize resources across the agency, it would be difficult to match an unsolicited Form I-693 with the related adjustment of status applications in a timely and efficient manner. This could delay the adjudication of adjustment of status applications while Forms I-693 are matched up to adjustment applications. We are proactively identifying employment-based adjustment of status applications with available visas that lack a valid Form I-693 and contacting applicants directly to request that form. If your underlying petition is approved and a visa is available to you, but you know that your previously filed Form I-485 does not have a valid Form I-693, it will help USCIS use the available visas and adjudicate your application if youvisit a civil surgeonand have a valid Form I-693 on hand when we send the request to you. Q. My immigrant visa petition has been approved and I have a pending adjustment of status application. What happens next? A. USCIS transfers adjustment of status applications in the first three employment-based preference categories from the Texas Service Center (TSC) and Nebraska Service Center (NSC) to the National Benefits Center (NBC) after the approval of the petition. The Field Operations Directorate will adjudicate the adjustment of status applications. (Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Under what circumstances does the National Benefits Center (NBC) adjudicate employment-based adjustment of status applications? A. The NBC is responsible for the final adjudication of EB I-485s that have been reviewed by an officer in the field or at a service center where the case is eligible for approval but for the fact that the visa is unavailable. Cases meeting this criterion are referred to as “regressed visa cases.” Regressed visa cases are sent to the NBC where a review is conducted to ensure information is properly captured in USCIS systems, the records are complete, and to confirm the visa is unavailable. When a visa becomes available (either through a Visa Bulletin update or through a change of visa classification to one with an available visa) and DOS has allocated an immigrant visa number, NBC will adjudicate the case to completion. Additionally, in other contexts and under certain conditions, if a case is located at the NBC and meets the interview waiver criteria, the NBC may adjudicate to completion. Examples of other instances in which the NBC may adjudicate a Form I-485 to completion include cases reopened on service motion where the denial was issued by NBC, cases associated with litigation, or other time sensitive cases. Q. My employment-based adjustment of status application is currently at the TSC or NSC. Do the published processing times for the TSC or NSC show how long it will take to process my application? A. The TSC and NSC are responsible for adjudicating employment-based petitions. Upon approval of the petitions, adjustment of status applications in the first three employment-based preference categories are then generally sent to the NBC and are adjudicated by the Field Operations Directorate. Only a few adjustment applications in EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3, usually with complex fact patterns and extended procedural histories, will remain at TSC and NSC for adjudication. Since very few adjustment applications in the first three employment-based preference categories are being adjudicated at the TSC and NSC, while those service centers are actively adjudicating EB-4 adjustment applications, the published processing times for adjustment of status applications at those service centers do not provide applicants in those first three categories with relevant information to estimate how long it will likely take to process their applications. If you have a pending employment-based adjustment of status application in the first three categories, the agency-wide fiscal year to date median processing time, available on uscis.gov atHistoric Processing Times, would be the most relevant processing time information. Q. Will my application for adjustment of status be processed faster if I submit my employment-based petition separately and then submit the application for adjustment of status the following day? A. No. Before the adjudication of an application for adjustment of status, the underlying employment-based petition must first be approved at the TSC or NSC. Applications filed for adjustment of status in the first three employment-based preference categories are sent to the NBC with their approved underlying employment-based petitions as part of the adjudication process, whether they are filed separately or concurrently. An adjustment of status application sent to the NBC cannot be adjudicated until the employment-based petition at the TSC or NSC has been adjudicated. For this reason, submitting the employment-based petition separately from the adjustment of status application does not result in an applicant receiving an earlier decision on their Form I-485. Q. If I have more than one pending application for adjustment of status, and USCIS approves one of them, what does it do with the others? A. If an alien has become a lawful permanent resident, USCIS would deny any other pending adjustment of status applications.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. What does a “Case Remains Pending” message mean in the USCIS Case Status Online tool and is USCIS proceeding with the adjudication of applications displaying this message? A. A “Case Remains Pending” message in the USCIS Case Status Online tool indicates that an officer reviewed the application and determined that it could not be approved on that date because DOS could not allocate a visa number. Once a visa number can be allocated, USCIS will resume the processing of the application but not every action that USCIS takes on an application results in a change in the message displayed in the online case status. If the applicant has submitted a transfer of underlying basis request, USCIS will continue processing that request and moving the application forward in the adjudication process.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. Why do some adjustment of status applicants see the status of their applications change to “Case Was Updated to Show Fingerprints Were Taken” in the USCIS Case Status Online tool when they had provided biometrics months earlier? A. This notification is made automatically as a result of an internal update made to USCIS systems. For example, more than 100,000 applicants who had previously provided biometrics received this automatic update in October and November 2022 and some applicants continue to see such automatic updates. USCIS received these applicants’ biometrics previously and still has them associated with their applications in its systems. If you received this notice as a result of the automatic update, your case will continue to be processed per standard procedures.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Why do adjustment of status applicants who have lived in the United States for many years have to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the health-related grounds ofINA 212(a)(1)? A. USCIS may only adjust the status of an alien to lawful permanent residence underINA 245(a)if the alien demonstrates that they are “admissible to the United States for permanent residence.” The statutory language relating to both adjustment of status and the health-related grounds of inadmissibility require USCIS to apply those grounds of inadmissibility to all adjustment of status applicants regardless of the number of years they have already lived in the United States in other statuses (with a limited exception for immunizations for certain adopted children 10 years of age or younger). USCIS cannot create a waiver or exemption from the health-related grounds of inadmissibility where Congress has not done so.(Updated 10/26/2022) Q. Why does USCIS conduct interviews for employment-based adjustment of status applications when a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin? A. USCIS conducts interviews for some employment-based adjustment of status applications even though a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin to ensure that USCIS can expediently approve those applications when a visa does become available and DOS has allocated an immigrant visa number. Visa availability is not the only consideration for the eligibility of an applicant for adjustment of status, and only after USCIS has determined in its discretion that an application is approvable do USCIS officers request a visa from DOS. In some cases, USCIS will issue written notices in the form of a Request for Evidence (RFE) to request initial or additional evidence to determine an applicant’s eligibility for adjustment of status. By conducting interviews before a visa is immediately available, officers can address any eligibility concerns and issue an RFE, if needed. If the applicant fails to demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, or that the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS can deny the application. If the application is approvable but for the lack of an available visa, when a visa becomes available and DOS allocates the visa, USCIS can approve the application without an additional delay. Q. Some aliens, particularly in the employment-based preference categories, have multiple pending adjustment of status applications. Can USCIS identify these in its inventory, and do the agencies take these multiple applications into account when setting the dates in the Visa Bulletin? A. Yes, we can identify multiple adjustment of status applications filed by the same alien (whether as a principal applicant or a derivative applicant) and do take them into account when collaborating with DOS on the Visa Bulletin. Generally, the volume of duplicate applications is very low and has minimal impact on the analysis. As of May 1, 2024, approximately 3% of the pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS were duplicates or multiple applications filed by the same alien. For alien chargeable to India, approximately 4% were duplicate applications. Narrowing it further to only EB-2 and EB-3 applications filed by aliens chargeable to India, approximately 5% were duplicate applications. Please note that these percentages apply to the entire inventory of pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS as of May 1, 2024, regardless of visa availability or priority date Q. Does USCIS have a target value for employment-based adjustment of status inventory that carries over from one fiscal year into the next? A. No, USCIS does not have a target value for its inventory of employment-based adjustment of status applications for the beginning of a fiscal year. While a reasonable volume of pending applications allows USCIS to maintain a steady pace of adjudications in the first quarter of a fiscal year, the volume that is pending merely reflects where applications may be in the multi-step adjudication process and general visa availability rather than the result of deliberately preparing inventory for the new fiscal year. Q. Why does USCIS not adjudicate all pending adjustment of status applications where the applicants have available visas during a given month? A. USCIS and its partners at DOS are committed to using all of the available employment-based visas during this fiscal year, as we are every year, but that visa use cannot happen within one month or even one quarter given statutory (in particular the quarterly limit of 27% found in INA 201(a)(2)) and operational limitations. Generally, visas are available under the Final Action Dates chart to more aliens than DOS and USCIS can approve within a given month or quarter due to operational considerations. When setting the Final Action Dates, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them. Q. I have a pending adjustment of status application based on an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition with an associated job offer. Must I work for the petitioning employer while my adjustment of status application is pending? Am I required to be working in the same occupational field as the job offer while my application is pending? Would a period of unemployment while my application is pending affect my eligibility for adjustment of status? A. Aliens with pending adjustment of status applications are not required to work, or ever have worked, for their petitioning employer. An employer who petitions for a alien worker is doing so prospectively. In other words, by filing the I-140 petition, the prospective employer declares their desire and intent to employ the alien upon the alien becoming an LPR. The alien who is the beneficiary of the petition is not required to work for the petitioning employer before the petition is filed, while the petition is pending, or while the adjustment of status application is pending. However, when applying for adjustment of status, the applicant must demonstrate that the employer still intends to offer them the job and that they intend to accept the job when they become an LPR. The alien is not required to be employed in the occupational classification of the prospective job while their adjustment of status application is pending in order to be eligible for adjustment of status based on the petition. Finally, an alien with a pending adjustment of status application based on a prospective job offer may be unemployed while their adjustment of status application is pending and, depending on the facts involved, may remain eligible for adjustment of status. However, a period of employment in an occupational classification different from the prospective job or a period of unemployment may affect a alien's current immigration status and could raise doubts about the continued validity of the job offer and/or the alien's intention to accept the offered position after adjustment.(Added 9/15/2023) ​Q. I have a challenging relationship with my petitioning employer, and I am worried that they may withdraw the petition. What effect would the withdrawal of the petition have on my petition, priority date, and pathway to adjustment of status? A. The petitioner may request to withdraw a Form I-140 at any time. However, if the petitioner requests to withdraw a Form I-140 that has already been approved for at least 180 days, or if an associated Form I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, USCIS will not revoke the approved Form I-140 and the beneficiary will retain the priority date from the Form I-140. If you already have a Form I-485 that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be eligible for portability under INA 204(j) based on a new job offer in the same or similar occupational classification. If you have not yet filed Form I-485 or your Form I-485 has not been pending for at least 180 days, while you retain the priority date from the approved petition you would need a different Form I-140 petition filed and approved on your behalf in order to adjust status under the employment-based first, second or third preference categories.

          "question": "Q. If I did not file a Form I-693 with my pending Form I-485, should I send one in now or wait for USCIS to request it, and why?",
          "answer": "A. Aliens with pending adjustment of status applications should not send an unsolicitedForm I-693to us. Given the rapid movement of files between directorates and offices as we strive to optimize resources across the agency, it would be difficult to match an unsolicited Form I-693 with the related adjustment of status applications in a timely and efficient manner. This could delay the adjudication of adjustment of status applications while Forms I-693 are matched up to adjustment applications. We are proactively identifying employment-based adjustment of status applications with available visas that lack a valid Form I-693 and contacting applicants directly to request that form. If your underlying petition is approved and a visa is available to you, but you know that your previously filed Form I-485 does not have a valid Form I-693, it will help USCIS use the available visas and adjudicate your application if youvisit a civil surgeonand have a valid Form I-693 on hand when we send the request to you. Q. My immigrant visa petition has been approved and I have a pending adjustment of status application. What happens next? A. USCIS transfers adjustment of status applications in the first three employment-based preference categories from the Texas Service Center (TSC) and Nebraska Service Center (NSC) to the National Benefits Center (NBC) after the approval of the petition. The Field Operations Directorate will adjudicate the adjustment of status applications. (Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Under what circumstances does the National Benefits Center (NBC) adjudicate employment-based adjustment of status applications? A. The NBC is responsible for the final adjudication of EB I-485s that have been reviewed by an officer in the field or at a service center where the case is eligible for approval but for the fact that the visa is unavailable. Cases meeting this criterion are referred to as “regressed visa cases.” Regressed visa cases are sent to the NBC where a review is conducted to ensure information is properly captured in USCIS systems, the records are complete, and to confirm the visa is unavailable. When a visa becomes available (either through a Visa Bulletin update or through a change of visa classification to one with an available visa) and DOS has allocated an immigrant visa number, NBC will adjudicate the case to completion. Additionally, in other contexts and under certain conditions, if a case is located at the NBC and meets the interview waiver criteria, the NBC may adjudicate to completion. Examples of other instances in which the NBC may adjudicate a Form I-485 to completion include cases reopened on service motion where the denial was issued by NBC, cases associated with litigation, or other time sensitive cases. Q. My employment-based adjustment of status application is currently at the TSC or NSC. Do the published processing times for the TSC or NSC show how long it will take to process my application? A. The TSC and NSC are responsible for adjudicating employment-based petitions. Upon approval of the petitions, adjustment of status applications in the first three employment-based preference categories are then generally sent to the NBC and are adjudicated by the Field Operations Directorate. Only a few adjustment applications in EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3, usually with complex fact patterns and extended procedural histories, will remain at TSC and NSC for adjudication. Since very few adjustment applications in the first three employment-based preference categories are being adjudicated at the TSC and NSC, while those service centers are actively adjudicating EB-4 adjustment applications, the published processing times for adjustment of status applications at those service centers do not provide applicants in those first three categories with relevant information to estimate how long it will likely take to process their applications. If you have a pending employment-based adjustment of status application in the first three categories, the agency-wide fiscal year to date median processing time, available on uscis.gov atHistoric Processing Times, would be the most relevant processing time information. Q. Will my application for adjustment of status be processed faster if I submit my employment-based petition separately and then submit the application for adjustment of status the following day? A. No. Before the adjudication of an application for adjustment of status, the underlying employment-based petition must first be approved at the TSC or NSC. Applications filed for adjustment of status in the first three employment-based preference categories are sent to the NBC with their approved underlying employment-based petitions as part of the adjudication process, whether they are filed separately or concurrently. An adjustment of status application sent to the NBC cannot be adjudicated until the employment-based petition at the TSC or NSC has been adjudicated. For this reason, submitting the employment-based petition separately from the adjustment of status application does not result in an applicant receiving an earlier decision on their Form I-485. Q. If I have more than one pending application for adjustment of status, and USCIS approves one of them, what does it do with the others? A. If an alien has become a lawful permanent resident, USCIS would deny any other pending adjustment of status applications.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. What does a “Case Remains Pending” message mean in the USCIS Case Status Online tool and is USCIS proceeding with the adjudication of applications displaying this message? A. A “Case Remains Pending” message in the USCIS Case Status Online tool indicates that an officer reviewed the application and determined that it could not be approved on that date because DOS could not allocate a visa number. Once a visa number can be allocated, USCIS will resume the processing of the application but not every action that USCIS takes on an application results in a change in the message displayed in the online case status. If the applicant has submitted a transfer of underlying basis request, USCIS will continue processing that request and moving the application forward in the adjudication process.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. Why do some adjustment of status applicants see the status of their applications change to “Case Was Updated to Show Fingerprints Were Taken” in the USCIS Case Status Online tool when they had provided biometrics months earlier? A. This notification is made automatically as a result of an internal update made to USCIS systems. For example, more than 100,000 applicants who had previously provided biometrics received this automatic update in October and November 2022 and some applicants continue to see such automatic updates. USCIS received these applicants’ biometrics previously and still has them associated with their applications in its systems. If you received this notice as a result of the automatic update, your case will continue to be processed per standard procedures.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Why do adjustment of status applicants who have lived in the United States for many years have to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the health-related grounds ofINA 212(a)(1)? A. USCIS may only adjust the status of an alien to lawful permanent residence underINA 245(a)if the alien demonstrates that they are “admissible to the United States for permanent residence.” The statutory language relating to both adjustment of status and the health-related grounds of inadmissibility require USCIS to apply those grounds of inadmissibility to all adjustment of status applicants regardless of the number of years they have already lived in the United States in other statuses (with a limited exception for immunizations for certain adopted children 10 years of age or younger). USCIS cannot create a waiver or exemption from the health-related grounds of inadmissibility where Congress has not done so.(Updated 10/26/2022) Q. Why does USCIS conduct interviews for employment-based adjustment of status applications when a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin? A. USCIS conducts interviews for some employment-based adjustment of status applications even though a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin to ensure that USCIS can expediently approve those applications when a visa does become available and DOS has allocated an immigrant visa number. Visa availability is not the only consideration for the eligibility of an applicant for adjustment of status, and only after USCIS has determined in its discretion that an application is approvable do USCIS officers request a visa from DOS. In some cases, USCIS will issue written notices in the form of a Request for Evidence (RFE) to request initial or additional evidence to determine an applicant’s eligibility for adjustment of status. By conducting interviews before a visa is immediately available, officers can address any eligibility concerns and issue an RFE, if needed. If the applicant fails to demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, or that the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS can deny the application. If the application is approvable but for the lack of an available visa, when a visa becomes available and DOS allocates the visa, USCIS can approve the application without an additional delay. Q. Some aliens, particularly in the employment-based preference categories, have multiple pending adjustment of status applications. Can USCIS identify these in its inventory, and do the agencies take these multiple applications into account when setting the dates in the Visa Bulletin? A. Yes, we can identify multiple adjustment of status applications filed by the same alien (whether as a principal applicant or a derivative applicant) and do take them into account when collaborating with DOS on the Visa Bulletin. Generally, the volume of duplicate applications is very low and has minimal impact on the analysis. As of May 1, 2024, approximately 3% of the pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS were duplicates or multiple applications filed by the same alien. For alien chargeable to India, approximately 4% were duplicate applications. Narrowing it further to only EB-2 and EB-3 applications filed by aliens chargeable to India, approximately 5% were duplicate applications. Please note that these percentages apply to the entire inventory of pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS as of May 1, 2024, regardless of visa availability or priority date Q. Does USCIS have a target value for employment-based adjustment of status inventory that carries over from one fiscal year into the next? A. No, USCIS does not have a target value for its inventory of employment-based adjustment of status applications for the beginning of a fiscal year. While a reasonable volume of pending applications allows USCIS to maintain a steady pace of adjudications in the first quarter of a fiscal year, the volume that is pending merely reflects where applications may be in the multi-step adjudication process and general visa availability rather than the result of deliberately preparing inventory for the new fiscal year. Q. Why does USCIS not adjudicate all pending adjustment of status applications where the applicants have available visas during a given month? A. USCIS and its partners at DOS are committed to using all of the available employment-based visas during this fiscal year, as we are every year, but that visa use cannot happen within one month or even one quarter given statutory (in particular the quarterly limit of 27% found in INA 201(a)(2)) and operational limitations. Generally, visas are available under the Final Action Dates chart to more aliens than DOS and USCIS can approve within a given month or quarter due to operational considerations. When setting the Final Action Dates, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them. Q. I have a pending adjustment of status application based on an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition with an associated job offer. Must I work for the petitioning employer while my adjustment of status application is pending? Am I required to be working in the same occupational field as the job offer while my application is pending? Would a period of unemployment while my application is pending affect my eligibility for adjustment of status? A. Aliens with pending adjustment of status applications are not required to work, or ever have worked, for their petitioning employer. An employer who petitions for a alien worker is doing so prospectively. In other words, by filing the I-140 petition, the prospective employer declares their desire and intent to employ the alien upon the alien becoming an LPR. The alien who is the beneficiary of the petition is not required to work for the petitioning employer before the petition is filed, while the petition is pending, or while the adjustment of status application is pending. However, when applying for adjustment of status, the applicant must demonstrate that the employer still intends to offer them the job and that they intend to accept the job when they become an LPR. The alien is not required to be employed in the occupational classification of the prospective job while their adjustment of status application is pending in order to be eligible for adjustment of status based on the petition. Finally, an alien with a pending adjustment of status application based on a prospective job offer may be unemployed while their adjustment of status application is pending and, depending on the facts involved, may remain eligible for adjustment of status. However, a period of employment in an occupational classification different from the prospective job or a period of unemployment may affect a alien's current immigration status and could raise doubts about the continued validity of the job offer and/or the alien's intention to accept the offered position after adjustment.(Added 9/15/2023) ​Q. I have a challenging relationship with my petitioning employer, and I am worried that they may withdraw the petition. What effect would the withdrawal of the petition have on my petition, priority date, and pathway to adjustment of status? A. The petitioner may request to withdraw a Form I-140 at any time. However, if the petitioner requests to withdraw a Form I-140 that has already been approved for at least 180 days, or if an associated Form I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, USCIS will not revoke the approved Form I-140 and the beneficiary will retain the priority date from the Form I-140. If you already have a Form I-485 that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be eligible for portability under INA 204(j) based on a new job offer in the same or similar occupational classification. If you have not yet filed Form I-485 or your Form I-485 has not been pending for at least 180 days, while you retain the priority date from the approved petition you would need a different Form I-140 petition filed and approved on your behalf in order to adjust status under the employment-based first, second or third preference categories.

In some cases, USCIS will issue written notices in the form of a Request for Evidence (RFE) to request initial or additional evidence to determine an applicant’s eligibility for adjustment of status. By conducting interviews before a visa is immediately available, officers can address any eligibility concerns and issue an RFE, if needed. If the applicant fails to demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, or that the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS can deny the application. If the application is approvable but for the lack of an available visa, when a visa becomes available and DOS allocates the visa, USCIS can approve the application without an additional delay. Q. Some aliens, particularly in the employment-based preference categories, have multiple pending adjustment of status applications. Can USCIS identify these in its inventory, and do the agencies take these multiple applications into account when setting the dates in the Visa Bulletin? A. Yes, we can identify multiple adjustment of status applications filed by the same alien (whether as a principal applicant or a derivative applicant) and do take them into account when collaborating with DOS on the Visa Bulletin. Generally, the volume of duplicate applications is very low and has minimal impact on the analysis. As of May 1, 2024, approximately 3% of the pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS were duplicates or multiple applications filed by the same alien. For alien chargeable to India, approximately 4% were duplicate applications. Narrowing it further to only EB-2 and EB-3 applications filed by aliens chargeable to India, approximately 5% were duplicate applications. Please note that these percentages apply to the entire inventory of pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS as of May 1, 2024, regardless of visa availability or priority date Q. Does USCIS have a target value for employment-based adjustment of status inventory that carries over from one fiscal year into the next? A. No, USCIS does not have a target value for its inventory of employment-based adjustment of status applications for the beginning of a fiscal year. While a reasonable volume of pending applications allows USCIS to maintain a steady pace of adjudications in the first quarter of a fiscal year, the volume that is pending merely reflects where applications may be in the multi-step adjudication process and general visa availability rather than the result of deliberately preparing inventory for the new fiscal year. Q. Why does USCIS not adjudicate all pending adjustment of status applications where the applicants have available visas during a given month? A. USCIS and its partners at DOS are committed to using all of the available employment-based visas during this fiscal year, as we are every year, but that visa use cannot happen within one month or even one quarter given statutory (in particular the quarterly limit of 27% found in INA 201(a)(2)) and operational limitations. Generally, visas are available under the Final Action Dates chart to more aliens than DOS and USCIS can approve within a given month or quarter due to operational considerations. When setting the Final Action Dates, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them. Q. I have a pending adjustment of status application based on an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition with an associated job offer. Must I work for the petitioning employer while my adjustment of status application is pending? Am I required to be working in the same occupational field as the job offer while my application is pending? Would a period of unemployment while my application is pending affect my eligibility for adjustment of status? A. Aliens with pending adjustment of status applications are not required to work, or ever have worked, for their petitioning employer. An employer who petitions for a alien worker is doing so prospectively. In other words, by filing the I-140 petition, the prospective employer declares their desire and intent to employ the alien upon the alien becoming an LPR. The alien who is the beneficiary of the petition is not required to work for the petitioning employer before the petition is filed, while the petition is pending, or while the adjustment of status application is pending. However, when applying for adjustment of status, the applicant must demonstrate that the employer still intends to offer them the job and that they intend to accept the job when they become an LPR. The alien is not required to be employed in the occupational classification of the prospective job while their adjustment of status application is pending in order to be eligible for adjustment of status based on the petition. Finally, an alien with a pending adjustment of status application based on a prospective job offer may be unemployed while their adjustment of status application is pending and, depending on the facts involved, may remain eligible for adjustment of status. However, a period of employment in an occupational classification different from the prospective job or a period of unemployment may affect a alien's current immigration status and could raise doubts about the continued validity of the job offer and/or the alien's intention to accept the offered position after adjustment.(Added 9/15/2023) ​Q. I have a challenging relationship with my petitioning employer, and I am worried that they may withdraw the petition. What effect would the withdrawal of the petition have on my petition, priority date, and pathway to adjustment of status? A. The petitioner may request to withdraw a Form I-140 at any time. However, if the petitioner requests to withdraw a Form I-140 that has already been approved for at least 180 days, or if an associated Form I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, USCIS will not revoke the approved Form I-140 and the beneficiary will retain the priority date from the Form I-140. If you already have a Form I-485 that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be eligible for portability under INA 204(j) based on a new job offer in the same or similar occupational classification. If you have not yet filed Form I-485 or your Form I-485 has not been pending for at least 180 days, while you retain the priority date from the approved petition you would need a different Form I-140 petition filed and approved on your behalf in order to adjust status under the employment-based first, second or third preference categories.

          "question": "Q. My employment-based adjustment of status application is currently at the TSC or NSC. Do the published processing times for the TSC or NSC show how long it will take to process my application?",
          "answer": "A. The TSC and NSC are responsible for adjudicating employment-based petitions. Upon approval of the petitions, adjustment of status applications in the first three employment-based preference categories are then generally sent to the NBC and are adjudicated by the Field Operations Directorate. Only a few adjustment applications in EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3, usually with complex fact patterns and extended procedural histories, will remain at TSC and NSC for adjudication. Since very few adjustment applications in the first three employment-based preference categories are being adjudicated at the TSC and NSC, while those service centers are actively adjudicating EB-4 adjustment applications, the published processing times for adjustment of status applications at those service centers do not provide applicants in those first three categories with relevant information to estimate how long it will likely take to process their applications. If you have a pending employment-based adjustment of status application in the first three categories, the agency-wide fiscal year to date median processing time, available on uscis.gov atHistoric Processing Times, would be the most relevant processing time information. Q. Will my application for adjustment of status be processed faster if I submit my employment-based petition separately and then submit the application for adjustment of status the following day? A. No. Before the adjudication of an application for adjustment of status, the underlying employment-based petition must first be approved at the TSC or NSC. Applications filed for adjustment of status in the first three employment-based preference categories are sent to the NBC with their approved underlying employment-based petitions as part of the adjudication process, whether they are filed separately or concurrently. An adjustment of status application sent to the NBC cannot be adjudicated until the employment-based petition at the TSC or NSC has been adjudicated. For this reason, submitting the employment-based petition separately from the adjustment of status application does not result in an applicant receiving an earlier decision on their Form I-485. Q. If I have more than one pending application for adjustment of status, and USCIS approves one of them, what does it do with the others? A. If an alien has become a lawful permanent resident, USCIS would deny any other pending adjustment of status applications.(Added 10/26/2022) Q. What does a “Case Remains Pending” message mean in the USCIS Case Status Online tool and is USCIS proceeding with the adjudication of applications displaying this message? A. A “Case Remains Pending” message in the USCIS Case Status Online tool indicates that an officer reviewed the application and determined that it could not be approved on that date because DOS could not allocate a visa number. Once a visa number can be allocated, USCIS will resume the processing of the application but not every action that USCIS takes on an application results in a change in the message displayed in the online case status. If the applicant has submitted a transfer of underlying basis request, USCIS will continue processing that request and moving the application forward in the adjudication process.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. Why do some adjustment of status applicants see the status of their applications change to “Case Was Updated to Show Fingerprints Were Taken” in the USCIS Case Status Online tool when they had provided biometrics months earlier? A. This notification is made automatically as a result of an internal update made to USCIS systems. For example, more than 100,000 applicants who had previously provided biometrics received this automatic update in October and November 2022 and some applicants continue to see such automatic updates. USCIS received these applicants’ biometrics previously and still has them associated with their applications in its systems. If you received this notice as a result of the automatic update, your case will continue to be processed per standard procedures.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Why do adjustment of status applicants who have lived in the United States for many years have to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the health-related grounds ofINA 212(a)(1)? A. USCIS may only adjust the status of an alien to lawful permanent residence underINA 245(a)if the alien demonstrates that they are “admissible to the United States for permanent residence.” The statutory language relating to both adjustment of status and the health-related grounds of inadmissibility require USCIS to apply those grounds of inadmissibility to all adjustment of status applicants regardless of the number of years they have already lived in the United States in other statuses (with a limited exception for immunizations for certain adopted children 10 years of age or younger). USCIS cannot create a waiver or exemption from the health-related grounds of inadmissibility where Congress has not done so.(Updated 10/26/2022) Q. Why does USCIS conduct interviews for employment-based adjustment of status applications when a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin? A. USCIS conducts interviews for some employment-based adjustment of status applications even though a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin to ensure that USCIS can expediently approve those applications when a visa does become available and DOS has allocated an immigrant visa number.

Why do adjustment of status applicants who have lived in the United States for many years have to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the health-related grounds ofINA 212(a)(1)? A. USCIS may only adjust the status of an alien to lawful permanent residence underINA 245(a)if the alien demonstrates that they are “admissible to the United States for permanent residence.” The statutory language relating to both adjustment of status and the health-related grounds of inadmissibility require USCIS to apply those grounds of inadmissibility to all adjustment of status applicants regardless of the number of years they have already lived in the United States in other statuses (with a limited exception for immunizations for certain adopted children 10 years of age or younger). USCIS cannot create a waiver or exemption from the health-related grounds of inadmissibility where Congress has not done so.(Updated 10/26/2022) Q. Why does USCIS conduct interviews for employment-based adjustment of status applications when a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin? A. USCIS conducts interviews for some employment-based adjustment of status applications even though a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin to ensure that USCIS can expediently approve those applications when a visa does become available and DOS has allocated an immigrant visa number. Visa availability is not the only consideration for the eligibility of an applicant for adjustment of status, and only after USCIS has determined in its discretion that an application is approvable do USCIS officers request a visa from DOS. In some cases, USCIS will issue written notices in the form of a Request for Evidence (RFE) to request initial or additional evidence to determine an applicant’s eligibility for adjustment of status. By conducting interviews before a visa is immediately available, officers can address any eligibility concerns and issue an RFE, if needed. If the applicant fails to demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, or that the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS can deny the application. If the application is approvable but for the lack of an available visa, when a visa becomes available and DOS allocates the visa, USCIS can approve the application without an additional delay. Q. Some aliens, particularly in the employment-based preference categories, have multiple pending adjustment of status applications. Can USCIS identify these in its inventory, and do the agencies take these multiple applications into account when setting the dates in the Visa Bulletin? A. Yes, we can identify multiple adjustment of status applications filed by the same alien (whether as a principal applicant or a derivative applicant) and do take them into account when collaborating with DOS on the Visa Bulletin. Generally, the volume of duplicate applications is very low and has minimal impact on the analysis. As of May 1, 2024, approximately 3% of the pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS were duplicates or multiple applications filed by the same alien. For alien chargeable to India, approximately 4% were duplicate applications. Narrowing it further to only EB-2 and EB-3 applications filed by aliens chargeable to India, approximately 5% were duplicate applications. Please note that these percentages apply to the entire inventory of pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS as of May 1, 2024, regardless of visa availability or priority date Q. Does USCIS have a target value for employment-based adjustment of status inventory that carries over from one fiscal year into the next? A. No, USCIS does not have a target value for its inventory of employment-based adjustment of status applications for the beginning of a fiscal year. While a reasonable volume of pending applications allows USCIS to maintain a steady pace of adjudications in the first quarter of a fiscal year, the volume that is pending merely reflects where applications may be in the multi-step adjudication process and general visa availability rather than the result of deliberately preparing inventory for the new fiscal year. Q. Why does USCIS not adjudicate all pending adjustment of status applications where the applicants have available visas during a given month? A. USCIS and its partners at DOS are committed to using all of the available employment-based visas during this fiscal year, as we are every year, but that visa use cannot happen within one month or even one quarter given statutory (in particular the quarterly limit of 27% found in INA 201(a)(2)) and operational limitations. Generally, visas are available under the Final Action Dates chart to more aliens than DOS and USCIS can approve within a given month or quarter due to operational considerations. When setting the Final Action Dates, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them. Q. I have a pending adjustment of status application based on an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition with an associated job offer. Must I work for the petitioning employer while my adjustment of status application is pending? Am I required to be working in the same occupational field as the job offer while my application is pending? Would a period of unemployment while my application is pending affect my eligibility for adjustment of status? A. Aliens with pending adjustment of status applications are not required to work, or ever have worked, for their petitioning employer. An employer who petitions for a alien worker is doing so prospectively. In other words, by filing the I-140 petition, the prospective employer declares their desire and intent to employ the alien upon the alien becoming an LPR. The alien who is the beneficiary of the petition is not required to work for the petitioning employer before the petition is filed, while the petition is pending, or while the adjustment of status application is pending. However, when applying for adjustment of status, the applicant must demonstrate that the employer still intends to offer them the job and that they intend to accept the job when they become an LPR. The alien is not required to be employed in the occupational classification of the prospective job while their adjustment of status application is pending in order to be eligible for adjustment of status based on the petition. Finally, an alien with a pending adjustment of status application based on a prospective job offer may be unemployed while their adjustment of status application is pending and, depending on the facts involved, may remain eligible for adjustment of status. However, a period of employment in an occupational classification different from the prospective job or a period of unemployment may affect a alien's current immigration status and could raise doubts about the continued validity of the job offer and/or the alien's intention to accept the offered position after adjustment.(Added 9/15/2023) ​Q. I have a challenging relationship with my petitioning employer, and I am worried that they may withdraw the petition. What effect would the withdrawal of the petition have on my petition, priority date, and pathway to adjustment of status? A. The petitioner may request to withdraw a Form I-140 at any time. However, if the petitioner requests to withdraw a Form I-140 that has already been approved for at least 180 days, or if an associated Form I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, USCIS will not revoke the approved Form I-140 and the beneficiary will retain the priority date from the Form I-140. If you already have a Form I-485 that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be eligible for portability under INA 204(j) based on a new job offer in the same or similar occupational classification. If you have not yet filed Form I-485 or your Form I-485 has not been pending for at least 180 days, while you retain the priority date from the approved petition you would need a different Form I-140 petition filed and approved on your behalf in order to adjust status under the employment-based first, second or third preference categories.

          "question": "Q. What does a “Case Remains Pending” message mean in the USCIS Case Status Online tool and is USCIS proceeding with the adjudication of applications displaying this message?",
          "answer": "A. A “Case Remains Pending” message in the USCIS Case Status Online tool indicates that an officer reviewed the application and determined that it could not be approved on that date because DOS could not allocate a visa number. Once a visa number can be allocated, USCIS will resume the processing of the application but not every action that USCIS takes on an application results in a change in the message displayed in the online case status. If the applicant has submitted a transfer of underlying basis request, USCIS will continue processing that request and moving the application forward in the adjudication process.(Updated 03/22/2023) Q. Why do some adjustment of status applicants see the status of their applications change to “Case Was Updated to Show Fingerprints Were Taken” in the USCIS Case Status Online tool when they had provided biometrics months earlier? A. This notification is made automatically as a result of an internal update made to USCIS systems. For example, more than 100,000 applicants who had previously provided biometrics received this automatic update in October and November 2022 and some applicants continue to see such automatic updates. USCIS received these applicants’ biometrics previously and still has them associated with their applications in its systems. If you received this notice as a result of the automatic update, your case will continue to be processed per standard procedures.(Updated 12/8/2023) Q. Why do adjustment of status applicants who have lived in the United States for many years have to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the health-related grounds ofINA 212(a)(1)? A. USCIS may only adjust the status of an alien to lawful permanent residence underINA 245(a)if the alien demonstrates that they are “admissible to the United States for permanent residence.” The statutory language relating to both adjustment of status and the health-related grounds of inadmissibility require USCIS to apply those grounds of inadmissibility to all adjustment of status applicants regardless of the number of years they have already lived in the United States in other statuses (with a limited exception for immunizations for certain adopted children 10 years of age or younger). USCIS cannot create a waiver or exemption from the health-related grounds of inadmissibility where Congress has not done so.(Updated 10/26/2022) Q. Why does USCIS conduct interviews for employment-based adjustment of status applications when a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin? A. USCIS conducts interviews for some employment-based adjustment of status applications even though a visa is not currently available under the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin to ensure that USCIS can expediently approve those applications when a visa does become available and DOS has allocated an immigrant visa number. Visa availability is not the only consideration for the eligibility of an applicant for adjustment of status, and only after USCIS has determined in its discretion that an application is approvable do USCIS officers request a visa from DOS. In some cases, USCIS will issue written notices in the form of a Request for Evidence (RFE) to request initial or additional evidence to determine an applicant’s eligibility for adjustment of status. By conducting interviews before a visa is immediately available, officers can address any eligibility concerns and issue an RFE, if needed. If the applicant fails to demonstrate eligibility for adjustment of status, or that the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion, USCIS can deny the application. If the application is approvable but for the lack of an available visa, when a visa becomes available and DOS allocates the visa, USCIS can approve the application without an additional delay. Q. Some aliens, particularly in the employment-based preference categories, have multiple pending adjustment of status applications. Can USCIS identify these in its inventory, and do the agencies take these multiple applications into account when setting the dates in the Visa Bulletin? A. Yes, we can identify multiple adjustment of status applications filed by the same alien (whether as a principal applicant or a derivative applicant) and do take them into account when collaborating with DOS on the Visa Bulletin. Generally, the volume of duplicate applications is very low and has minimal impact on the analysis. As of May 1, 2024, approximately 3% of the pending employment-based adjustment of status applications with USCIS were duplicates or multiple applications filed by the same alien.

When setting the Final Action Dates, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to: The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them. Q. I have a pending adjustment of status application based on an approved employment-based immigrant visa petition with an associated job offer. Must I work for the petitioning employer while my adjustment of status application is pending? Am I required to be working in the same occupational field as the job offer while my application is pending? Would a period of unemployment while my application is pending affect my eligibility for adjustment of status? A. Aliens with pending adjustment of status applications are not required to work, or ever have worked, for their petitioning employer. An employer who petitions for a alien worker is doing so prospectively. In other words, by filing the I-140 petition, the prospective employer declares their desire and intent to employ the alien upon the alien becoming an LPR. The alien who is the beneficiary of the petition is not required to work for the petitioning employer before the petition is filed, while the petition is pending, or while the adjustment of status application is pending. However, when applying for adjustment of status, the applicant must demonstrate that the employer still intends to offer them the job and that they intend to accept the job when they become an LPR. The alien is not required to be employed in the occupational classification of the prospective job while their adjustment of status application is pending in order to be eligible for adjustment of status based on the petition. Finally, an alien with a pending adjustment of status application based on a prospective job offer may be unemployed while their adjustment of status application is pending and, depending on the facts involved, may remain eligible for adjustment of status. However, a period of employment in an occupational classification different from the prospective job or a period of unemployment may affect a alien's current immigration status and could raise doubts about the continued validity of the job offer and/or the alien's intention to accept the offered position after adjustment.(Added 9/15/2023) ​Q. I have a challenging relationship with my petitioning employer, and I am worried that they may withdraw the petition. What effect would the withdrawal of the petition have on my petition, priority date, and pathway to adjustment of status? A. The petitioner may request to withdraw a Form I-140 at any time. However, if the petitioner requests to withdraw a Form I-140 that has already been approved for at least 180 days, or if an associated Form I-485 has been pending for at least 180 days, USCIS will not revoke the approved Form I-140 and the beneficiary will retain the priority date from the Form I-140. If you already have a Form I-485 that has been pending for at least 180 days, you may be eligible for portability under INA 204(j) based on a new job offer in the same or similar occupational classification. If you have not yet filed Form I-485 or your Form I-485 has not been pending for at least 180 days, while you retain the priority date from the approved petition you would need a different Form I-140 petition filed and approved on your behalf in order to adjust status under the employment-based first, second or third preference categories.

          "question": "Q. Does USCIS have a target value for employment-based adjustment of status inventory that carries over from one fiscal year into the next?",
          "answer": "A. No, USCIS does not have a target value for its inventory of employment-based adjustment of status applications for the beginning of a fiscal year. While a reasonable volume of pending applications allows USCIS to maintain a steady pace of adjudications in the first quarter of a fiscal year, the volume that is pending merely reflects where applications may be in the multi-step adjudication process and general visa availability rather than the result of deliberately preparing inventory for the new fiscal year. Q. Why does USCIS not adjudicate all pending adjustment of status applications where the applicants have available visas during a given month? A. USCIS and its partners at DOS are committed to using all of the available employment-based visas during this fiscal year, as we are every year, but that visa use cannot happen within one month or even one quarter given statutory (in particular the quarterly limit of 27% found in INA 201(a)(2)) and operational limitations.

          "question": "Because my lawful permanent resident status allows me to travel between the United States and my home country, can I live in both places until I am ready to apply for citizenship?",
          "answer": "Generally, to qualify for citizenship, you must demonstrate that you havecontinuously residedin the United States for at least 5 years before submitting Form N-400. This means you must be residing exclusively in the United States – not in any other country.You may travel to another country, including your home country, if no other legal impediment precludes you from doing so. However, if your trip lasts longer than 180 days, USCIS may determine that you have not continuously resided in the United States and therefore are ineligible for naturalization.In addition to examining the length of your trip abroad, USCIS will look at the frequency of your travel. To qualify for naturalization, an applicant must spend at least half of their time in the United States. This is known as the “physical presence” requirement. If you take frequent, short trips abroad that result in you spending more than half your time outside the United States, then you will also be ineligible for naturalization.The requirements of “continuous residence” and “physical presence” are interrelated but are different requirements. An applicant applying for naturalization must satisfy each eligibility requirement."

This includes the ability to speak and understand English. The speaking test occurs during the eligibility interview on Form N-400.During your naturalization interview, a USCIS officer will review the responses you provided on yourForm N-400, with you. The USCIS officer will ask questions to clarify or confirm your responses. Prepare to demonstrate your ability to speak and understand English by making sure you understand each question on the application and can respond to each question according to your situation.Applicants may ask the USCIS officer to repeat or rephrase questions during the naturalization interview. Certain applicants because of age and time as a lawful permanent resident are exempt from the English requirements for naturalization and may take the civics test in the language of their choice. For more information, seeexceptions and accommodations."

        {
          "question": "Can I legally change my name while my Form N-400 is pending?",
          "answer": "Yes. You can legally change your name while your Form N-400 is pending. If your name has changed after you filed an N-400, you must promptly provide USCIS with the document(s) that legally changed your name(s), such as a marriage certificate, divorce decree, court order, or other official record. Make sure to mention your name change and bring the documents related to your name change at the time of the interview.You can also legally change your name when you naturalize. The instructions to Form N-400 include information on what is required when you wish to change your name at the time of naturalization. At the time of the interview, the USCIS officer will record the name change request and ask you to sign a name change petition, which USCIS files with a court before the judicial oath ceremony. Upon receipt of the petition, the court signs and seals the petition. The petition is later presented to you during the naturalization ceremony as evidence of the name change.All name change requests facilitated through USCIS will require you to take the Oath of Allegiance at a judicial ceremony, rather than an administrative one because USCIS is not authorized to make name changes. As far as possible delays, USCIS has little control over the judicial ceremony calendar. However, most courts are accommodating of the need for naturalization ceremonies."

        {
          "question": "Do I need to bring original documents such as birth and marriage certificates to the naturalization interview?",
          "answer": "Yes. The instructions to Form N-400 provide an extensive list of examples of original documents that you should bring to the interview, depending on different case scenarios. Examples of these documents include original birth, marriage, divorce, final adoption and naturalization certificates; court orders/decrees; evidence of child support payments; court-certified arrest reports; and probation/parole records. Certain certified copies of documents can also be provided. You should also submit copies, preferably certified copies, of these documents at the initial filing of your application. These documents should be submitted as evidence in support of your application and will facilitate the USCIS officers’ review of your request."

        {
          "question": "What should I do if I have already applied for naturalization and my Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) is expiring?",
          "answer": "While lawful permanent resident status does not expire, barring naturalization or termination of status, a lawful permanent resident must have valid, unexpired proof of lawful permanent residence in their possession at all times. Applying for naturalization does not change this requirement. However, effective Dec. 12, 2022, an alien applying for naturalization who properly submits Form N-400 will receive a Form N-400 receipt notice that, when presented with their permanent resident card (Green Card), automatically extends the validity of the Green Card for 24 months from the “Card Expires” date. This receipt notice must be presented to show that your Green Card, which is proof of your lawful permanent resident status, has been extended, such as for purposes of employment or travel authorization. If your Green Card has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then you generally must fileForm, I-90 Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card.

See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(3).Return to top.II. Initial Requests for DACAQ31: What guidelines must I meet to be considered for DACA?A31: Under current court orders, we are accepting, but not adjudicating, initial requests for DACA. Under 8 CFR 236.22, to be considered for DACA you must submit evidence, including supporting documents, showing that you:Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981);Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up until you filed your request for DACA;Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and when you filed your request for DACA with USCIS;Had no lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012,* and when you filed your request for DACA, meaning that:You never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012, orAny lawful immigration status or parole that you had before June 15, 2012, expired as of June 15, 2012, andAny lawful status that you had after June 15, 2012, expired or otherwise ended before you submitted your request for DACA;Are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.We consider on a case-by-case basis deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Even if you meet the threshold criteria listed above and at 8 CFR 236.22(b), we retain the discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that any specific factor makes deferred action inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22(c).* Please review Q19 if you are currently in a lawful immigration status.Q32: I first came to the United States before I turned 16 years old, and I have been continuously residing in the United States since at least June 15, 2007. Before I turned 16 years old, however, I left the United States for some period before returning and beginning my current period of continuous residence. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A32: Yes, but only if you established residence in the United States during the period before you turned 16 years old, as evidenced, for example, by records showing you attended school or worked in the United States during that time, or that you lived in the United States for multiple years during that time. In addition to establishing that you initially resided in the United States before you turned 16 years old, you must also have maintained continuous residence in the United States from June 15, 2007, until the present time to be considered for deferred action under this process. See 8 CFR 236.22(b)(1)-(2).Q33: To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence documenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period?A33: To meet the continuous residence guideline under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(2), you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the United States from June 15, 2007, up until the time of filing your request. You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence.It is helpful for us if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the United States for the period since June 15, 2007. Gaps in the documentation for certain periods may raise doubts about your continued residence if they are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been outside the United States for a period that was not brief, casual or innocent.If gaps in your documentation raise questions, we may issue a Request for Evidence(RFE) to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous residence.You may submit affidavits to explain a gap in the documentation showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement. If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances during the period when there is a gap in the documentation. You may only use affidavits to explain gaps in your continuous residence; you cannot use them as evidence that you meet the entire 5-year continuous residence requirement.Q34: I came to the United States when I was very young and before I began attending school, so I do not have primary evidence of the start of my continuous residence in the United States. Can I submit an affidavit as proof of the start of my continuous residence period?A34: DHS will accept affidavits for the start of the continuous residence period if you are a new initial requestor who arrived in the United States at or before age 8. We recognize that age 8 is the highest age at which school attendance becomes required within the United States, and that it may be more challenging for individuals who arrived before that age to provide primary evidence of the start of their continuous residence period.Q35: Does “currently enrolled in school” refer to the date when I file the request for consideration of deferred action?A35: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in school on the date you submit a DACA request.Q36: Who is considered to be “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A36: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in:A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements;An education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; orAn education program helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) in the United States.Education, literacy, and career training programs (including vocational training), or education programs helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law, or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam in the United States, may include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations. Programs funded by other sources may qualify if they have demonstrated effectiveness.In assessing whether programs are of demonstrated effectiveness, we will consider:The duration of the program’s existence;The program’s track record in:Assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent;Passing a GED or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC); orPlacing students in postsecondary education, job training, or employment; andOther indicators of the program’s overall quality.If you seek to demonstrate that you are “currently enrolled in school” with your enrollment in such a program, you must show the program’s demonstrated effectiveness.Q37: How do I establish that I am currently enrolled in school?A37: Documentation showing that you are enrolled in school may include evidence that you are enrolled in:A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school or secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements; orAn education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that:Has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English, or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; andIs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness; orAn education program assisting students in obtaining a high school equivalency diploma or certificate recognized under state law (such as by passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), and that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness.Evidence of enrollment may include acceptance letters, school registration cards, letters from a school or program, transcripts, report cards, or progress reports that may show the name of the school or program, date of enrollment, and current educational or grade level, if relevant. See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents.Q38: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school?A38: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation showing that you have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to:A high school diploma from a public or private high school or secondary school; orA certificate of completion, a certificate of attendance, or an alternate award from a public or private high school or secondary school or a recognized equivalent of a high school diploma under state law, or a GED certificate or certificate from passing another such state authorized exam (e.g., HiSet or TASC) in the United States.Q39: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC)?A39: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation demonstrating that you have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to, evidence that you have passed a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) and received the recognized equivalent of a regular high school diploma under state law.Q40: If I am enrolled in a literacy or career training program, can I meet the guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A40: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) if you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. Such programs include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or if funded by other sources, are programs of demonstrated effectiveness.Q41: If I am enrolled in an English as a second language (ESL) program, can I meet the guidelines?A41: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) through enrollment in an ESL program if the ESL program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or is a program of demonstrated effectiveness. You must submit direct documentary evidence that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants, administered by a nonprofit organization, or of demonstrated effectiveness.Q42: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A42: No. We will not accept evidence that is not listed in Chart #1 to establish that you are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a GED or passed another state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5). You must submit any of the documentary evidence listed in Chart #1 to show that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5).Q43: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met certain threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?A43: You may use evidence other than those documents listed in Chart #1 to establish that you meet the following guidelines and factual showings, if available documentary evidence is insufficient or lacking and shows that:You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You satisfy the continuous residence requirement, if you present direct evidence of your continued residence in the United States for a portion of the required period and the circumstantial evidence is used only to fill in gaps in the length of continuous residence demonstrated by the direct evidence; andAny travel outside the United States during the period of required continuous presence was brief, casual, and innocent.However, we will not accept evidence other than the documents listed in Chart #1 as proof that you meet any of the following guidelines:You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYou are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States.For example, even if you do not have documentary proof of your presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, you may still be able to demonstrate that you meet the guideline. You may do so by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in the United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which may be enough to infer you were present June 15, 2012, as well. However, we will not accept evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit the designated documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet this guideline.Chart #1 provides examples of documentation you may submit to demonstrate you meet the threshold criteria for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Please see the instructions for Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, for additional details of acceptable documentation.Chart #1 Examples of Documents to Submit to Demonstrate You Meet the GuidelinesProof of identityPassport or national identity document from your country of originBirth certificate with photo identificationSchool or military ID with photoAny U.S. government immigration or other document bearing your name and photoProof you came to U.S. before your 16th birthdayPassport with admission stampForm I-94, Form I-95, or Form I-94WSchool records from the U.S. schools you have attendedAny Immigration and Naturalization Service or DHS document stating your date of entry (Form I-862, Notice to Appear)Travel recordsHospital or medical recordsRent receipts or utility billsEmployment records (pay stubs, W-2 Forms, etc.)Official records from a religious entity confirming participation in a religious ceremonyCopies of money order receipts for money sent in or out of the United StatesBirth certificates of children born in the United StatesDated bank transactionsAutomobile license receipts or registrationDeeds, mortgages, rental agreement contractsTax receipts, insurance policiesProof of lack of lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012, and at the time of filing your DACA request (8 CFR 236.22(b)(4))Form I-94/I-95/I-94W with authorized stay expiration dateFinal order of exclusion, deportation, or removal issued as of June 15, 2012A charging document placing you into removal proceedingsProof of physical presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of filing your DACA request (8 CFR 236.22(b)(3))Rent receipts or utility billsEmployment records (pay stubs, W-2 Forms, etc.)School records (letters, report cards, etc.)Military records (Form DD-214 or NGB Form 22)Official records from a religious entity confirming participation in a religious ceremonyCopies of money order receipts for money sent in or out of the United StatesPassport entriesBirth certificates of children born in the United StatesDated bank transactionsAutomobile license receipts or registrationDeeds, mortgages, rental agreement contractsTax receipts, insurance policiesAffidavits for the start of the continuous presence period if you arrived in the United States before age 8Proof you continuously resided in the United States from June 15, 2007, to the time of filing your DACA request (8 CFR 236.22(b)(2))Proof of your education status at the time of requesting consideration of DACA (8 CFR 236.22(b)(5))School records (transcripts, report cards, etc.) from the school that you are currently attending in the United States showing the name(s) of the school(s) and periods of school attendance and the current educational or grade levelU.S. high school diploma, certificate of completion, or other alternate awardHigh school equivalency diploma or certificate recognized under state lawEvidence that you passed a state-authorized exam, including the GED or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) in the United StatesProof you are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. armed forces or the U.S. Coast Guard (8 CFR 236.22(b)(5))Form DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active DutyNGB Form 22, National Guard Report of Separation and Record of ServiceMilitary personnel recordsMilitary health recordsQ44: May I file affidavits as proof that I meet the threshold criteria for consideration of DACA at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?A44: Affidavits generally will not be sufficient on their own to demonstrate that you meet the threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b) for us to consider you for DACA. However, you may use affidavits to support meeting the following guidelines if the documentary evidence available to you is insufficient or lacking:Showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement;Establishing the start of the continuous residence period if you entered the United States before age 8; andEstablishing that departures during the required period of continuous residence were brief, casual, and innocent.If you submit affidavits related to the above criteria, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself, who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances. If we determine that the affidavits are insufficient to overcome the unavailability or lack of documentary evidence with respect to either of these guidelines, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating you must submit further evidence to demonstrate that you meet these guidelines.We will not accept affidavits to satisfy the following guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b):You are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion or other alternate award from high school, have obtained a high school equivalency diploma or certificate (such as by passing the GED exam or other similar state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), or are an honorably discharged veteran from the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States;You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYour lack of disqualifying criminal history.If the only evidence you submit to demonstrate you meet any of the above guidelines is an affidavit, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating that you have not demonstrated that you meet these guidelines and that you must submit evidence to demonstrate that you meet that guideline.Q45: Can I be considered for deferred action under this process if I had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal pending before either USCIS or the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on June 15, 2012?A45: Yes. If you had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal, or similar relief, pending before either USCIS or EOIR as of June 15, 2012, but had no lawful status, you may request consideration of DACA.Q46: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I violated my immigration status (for example, by engaging in unauthorized employment, failing to report to my employer, or failing to pursue a full course of study) before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A46: No, unless the Executive Office for Immigration Review terminated your status by issuing a final order of removal against you before June 15, 2012.Q47: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I \"aged out\" of my dependent nonimmigrant status as of June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A47: Yes. For purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,\" guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if you were admitted for duration of status or for a period of time that extended past June 14, 2012, but aged out of your dependent nonimmigrant status on or before June 15, 2012, (meaning you turned 21 years old on or before June 15, 2012), you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q48: I was admitted for duration of status, but my status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is listed as terminated on or before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A48: Yes. For the purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,” guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if your status as of June 15, 2012, is listed as “terminated” in SEVIS, you may be considered for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q49: I am a Canadian citizen who was inspected by CBP but was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A49: In general, a Canadian citizen who was admitted as a visitor for business or pleasure and not issued a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record (also known as a “non-controlled” Canadian nonimmigrant) is lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. For that reason, unless there is evidence, including verifiable evidence provided by the individual, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time, DHS will consider, for purposes of 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 only, that the alien was lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. If DHS can verify from its records that your last noncontrolled entry occurred on or before Dec. 14, 2011, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q50: I used my Border Crossing Card (BCC) to obtain admission to the United States and was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A50: Because the limitations on entry for a BCC holder vary based on location of admission and travel, DHS will assume that the BCC holder who was not provided a Form I-94 was admitted for the longest period legally possible—30 days—unless the individual can demonstrate, through verifiable evidence, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time. Accordingly, if DHS is able to verify from its records that your last admission was using a BCC, you were not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission, and it occurred on or before May 14, 2012, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q51: Do I accrue unlawful presence if I have a pending initial request for consideration of DACA?A51: You will continue to accrue unlawful presence while the request for consideration of DACA is pending unless you are under 18 years of age at the time of the request. If you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your request, you will not accrue unlawful presence while the request is pending, even if you turn 18 while your request is pending with USCIS. If we grant your DACA request, you will not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action. However, having deferred action will not excuse previously accrued unlawful presence.Return to top.III. Renewal of DACAQ52: When should I file my DACA renewal request?A52: We strongly encourage you to submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice and EAD. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision.DACA recipients may submit a DACA renewal request online. To file Form I-821D and Form I-765 online, a DACA requestor must first create a USCIS online account, which provides a convenient and secure method to submit forms, pay fees and track the status of any pending USCIS immigration request throughout the adjudication process. There is no cost to set up an account, which offers a variety of features, including the ability to communicate with USCIS through a secure inbox and respond online to Requests for Evidence. For additional information on filing a DACA renewal request online, go to the Form I-821D webpage. All online DACA renewal requests must include Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS and accompanying fees.USCIS’ current goal is to process DACA renewal requests within 120 days. You may submit an inquiry online about the status of your renewal request after it has been pending more than 105 days. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to:If you fail to appear at an ASC for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. It will take longer to process your request if you miss or reschedule your appointments;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orA renewal submission that is incomplete or contains evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines and we must request additional evidence or an explanation.Q53: Can I file a renewal request outside the recommended filing period of 120 to 150 days before my current DACA expires?A53: We strongly encourages you to file your renewal request within the recommended 120- to 150-day filing period to minimize the possibility that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. We will accept requests we receive earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expires; however, this could result in an overlap between your current DACA and your renewal. This means your renewal period may extend for less than a full 2 years from the date that your current DACA period expires.If you file less than 120 days before your current period of DACA expires, there is more risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. If you file after your most recent DACA period expires, but within 1 year of its expiration, you may submit a request to renew your DACA. If you are filing beyond 1 year after your most recent period of DACA expired, or if your most recent grant of DACA was terminated at any time, you may still request DACA by submitting a new initial request.Please note: An ongoing July 16, 2021, injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and, on Oct. 14, 2022, was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect and prohibits DHS from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule. Due to the partial stay of the injunction, DHS presently may grant DACA renewal requests under the final rule.Q54: How will USCIS evaluate my request for renewal of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A54: We may consider renewing your DACA if you met the guidelines for consideration of Initial DACA (see above and 8 CFR 236.22(b)) and you:Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012;Have continuously resided in the United States since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved up to the present time; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.These guidelines must be met for consideration of DACA renewal. We consider deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 on a case-by-case basis. Even if you meet the guidelines, we have discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that deferred action is inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22I.Q55. Do I accrue unlawful presence if I am seeking renewal and my previous period of DACA expires before I receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA? Similarly, what would happen to my work authorization?A55: Yes, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will accrue unlawful presence for any time between the periods of deferred action, unless you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your renewal request.Similarly, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will not be authorized to work in the United States regardless of your age at time of filing until and unless you receive a new EAD from USCIS.Q56. Do I need to provide additional documents when I request renewal of deferred action under DACA?A56. No, unless you have new documents pertaining to removal proceedings or criminal history that you have not already submitted to USCIS in a previously approved DACA request. However, we reserve the authority, at our discretion, to request additional documents, information or statements relating to a DACA renewal request determination.CAUTION: If you knowingly and willfully provide materially false information on Form I-821D, you will be committing a federal felony punishable by a fine, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. In addition, you may be placed into removal proceedings, face severe penalties provided by law, and be subject to criminal prosecution.Q57.; If I am no longer enrolled in school, can I still request to renew my DACA?A57. Yes. Neither Form I-821D nor the instructions ask renewal requestors for information about continued school enrollment or graduation. The instructions for renewal requests specify that you may be considered for DACA renewal if you met the guidelines for consideration of initial DACA, including the educational guidelines and:Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without advance parole;Have continuously resided in the United States, up to the present time, since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)or 3 or more other misdemeanors and are not a threat to national security or public safety.Q58. If I initially received DACA and was under age 31 on June 15, 2012, but have since become 31 or older, can I still request renewal of DACA?A58. Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of DACA as long as you were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012. IV. TravelQ59: May I travel outside the United States before I submit an initial DACA request or while my initial DACA request is pending with USCIS?A59: Any unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt your continuous residence, and you will not be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. We will assess any travel outside of the United States that occurred on or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012, to determine whether the travel qualifies as brief, casual and innocent. (See Chart #2.)CAUTION: You should be aware that if you have been ordered deported or removed, and you then leave the United States, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.Q60: As a DACA recipient, can I travel outside of the United States?A60: Not automatically. If you want to travel outside the United States after receiving DACA, you must apply for an advance parole document by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and paying the applicable fee. We will determine whether your purpose for international travel is justifiable based on the circumstances you describe in your request. Generally, we will only issue an advance parole document if you want to travel outside the United States for:Humanitarian purposes, including to obtain medical treatment, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit an ailing relative;Educational purposes, such as semester abroad programs and academic research; orEmployment purposes, including but not limited to overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or training, consular appointment for an employer-sponsored nonimmigrant visa, or meetings with clients overseas.Travel for vacation is not a valid basis for advance parole.Travel for educational purposes means travel affiliated with an institution that provides education as its primary purpose. You do not have to be enrolled in the institution that the program is affiliated with, but you must be enrolled in the program you will be traveling with.You may not apply for an advance parole document unless and until we approve your DACA request. If you are submitting a DACA renewal request, you may apply for advance parole at the same time; however, there is a separate filing address for advance parole requests, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will consider all advance parole requests on a case-by-case basis.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131.If we have granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 after you have been ordered deported or removed, you may still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above.CAUTION: If you have been ordered deported or removed, before you leave the United States, you should seek to reopen your case before the EOIR and obtain administrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding. Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you should not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or removed, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, you may be considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. If you have any questions about this process, you may contact ICE through the local ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor with jurisdiction over your case.Q61: What happens to my DACA grant if I leave the United States without advance parole?A61: CAUTION: When you leave the United States, you are no longer in a period of deferred action. DACA recipients who leave the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States. We strongly encourage you to obtain an advance parole document before you leave to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA.We may terminate a grant of DACA, in our discretion and after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond, for DACA recipients who depart from the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document and subsequently enter the United States without inspection. See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(2). Generally, a recent entry without inspection will be a significant negative factor warranting termination of DACA as a threat to border security, but where there are exigent circumstances, such as accidental or involuntary border crossings, DHS may choose to continue exercising prosecutorial discretion and allow the grant of deferred action to continue.DACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining advance parole but who are paroled into the United States may resume their DACA upon expiration of the period of parole.Q62: Why does my advance parole document show a 1-day parole period?A62: Your advance parole document may show a parole period of 1 day because it is to facilitate your reentry into the United States, at which time you will resume your current DACA validity period. This is different from the language on your advance parole document that authorizes a departure and reentry between specified dates. Please review your advance parole document carefully to understand the details of your travel authorization.Q63: Do brief departures from the United States interrupt the continuous residence requirement?A63: A brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt continuous residence, regardless of whether it was otherwise brief, casual, and innocent. Your absence from the United States will be considered brief, casual, and innocent if it was on or after June 15, 2007, and before Aug. 15, 2012, and:The absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure before you were placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings; andThe purpose of the absence and your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law.Once we have approved your request for DACA, you may file Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States.CAUTION: If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without authorization and subsequently enter without inspection, DHS will issue you a Notice of Intent to Terminate and may, barring exigent circumstances, terminate your deferred action under DACA in its discretion,Travel Guidelines (Chart #2)Travel DatesType of TravelDoes It Affect Continuous ResidenceOn or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012Brief, casual and innocentNoFor an extended timeBecause of an order of exclusion, deportation, voluntary departure, or removalTo participate in criminal activityYesOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACAAnyYes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case, and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.In addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACAAnyOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after receiving DACAAnyIt depends. If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, if you travel without authorization, the travel will interrupt your continuous residence.Q64: May I file a request for advance parole at the same time I file my DACA package?A64: You may file an advance parole request at the same time as a DACA renewal request (but not at the same time as an initial DACA request). However, the filing addresses for a DACA renewal request and an advance parole request are different, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will not issue an advance parole document for a period that continues past your DACA validity period.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131.To request advance parole, you must submit Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. Please visit the Form I-131 webpage before you begin the process to make sure you are using the current version of the form. To request advance parole to travel outside the United States, you must complete and sign Form I-131 and include the required filing fee, as listed on the Form I-131 webpage.You can find information on where to file on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-131 webpage under “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).” If you do not send Form I-131 to the correct address, it may significantly delay adjudication of your application or cause us to deny it.Q65: Will USCIS expedite the processing of a DACA Form I-131 advance parole application currently pending with USCIS?A65: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within the sole discretion of USCIS. Please visit the USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitions for more information and guidance on expedite requests.Q66: What if I am experiencing an extremely urgent situation and have not filed my Form I-131 advance parole application?A66:If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation and need to travel within 90 days, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office by contacting the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment:A completed and signed Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (such as medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); and2 passport-style photos.Return to top.V. Criminal ConvictionsQ67: If I have a conviction for a felony offense, a misdemeanor offense described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or multiple other misdemeanors, can I be granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A67: No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, a misdemeanor offense described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct, we will not consider you for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q68: What offenses qualify as a felony?A68: A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year.A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.Q69: What offenses constitute disqualifying misdemeanors (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) for purposes of DACA?A69: For purposes of DACA, a misdemeanor (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) that meets the following criteria:Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; orIf not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence.The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE.A single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described above is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.Notwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of any misdemeanor convictions as described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion.Q70: What offenses constitute “other misdemeanors” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))?A70: For purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), an “other misdemeanor” is any misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater 5 days) that meets the following criteria:Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; andIs an offense for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE.Three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA.The decision to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors”  is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion.A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.Q71: If I have a minor traffic offense, such as driving without a license, will it be considered a misdemeanor that counts towards the “3 or more other misdemeanors” and make me unable to receive consideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A71: We will not consider a minor traffic offense a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), and it is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we can consider your entire offense history along with other facts to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, you warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.It is important to emphasize that driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), regardless of the sentence imposed.Q72: What qualifies as a national security or public safety threat?A72: If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request for deferred action indicates that your presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security, we will not grant your DACA request. Indicators that you pose such a threat include, but are not limited to, gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States.Q73: Will offenses criminalized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws be considered disqualifying convictions for purpose of DACA?A73: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), convictions under state laws (including U.S. territories) for immigration-related offenses are not considered convictions for purposes of DACA.Q74: Will USCIS consider my expunged conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication as a disqualifying conviction for purposes of DACA?A74: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), we do not consider expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications disqualifying convictions for purposes of DACA. However, we will assess expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, under the circumstances, you present a national security or public safety concern and a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is otherwise warranted. If you were a juvenile, but tried and convicted as an adult, we will not consider your conviction a juvenile delinquency adjudication.Return to top.VI. Employment AuthorizationQ75. What should I do if my EAD was lost, stolen, or damaged?A75. If your deferred action under DACA is currently valid, and you do not need to renew it, but you need to replace a valid EAD because yours was lost, stolen, or damaged, file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and select box 1.b. Submit the properly completed Form I-765, evidence that you are a current DACA recipient (such as your most recent DACA approval notice), and filing fee to the filing address for the location where you live.Do not file Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, with this Form I-765. If you submit Form I-821D when you are filing to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged EAD, we will deny your Form I-821D and we will not refund the $85 filing fee for Form I-821D.Return to top.VII. MiscellaneousQ76: Can USCIS terminate my DACA grant?A76: DHS may seek to terminate a grant of DACA at any time in its discretion. However, in most cases we will provide DACA recipients with a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT), with an opportunity to respond, before termination. We have discretion to terminate without providing a DACA recipient a NOIT and opportunity to respond if you were convicted of a national security-related offense involving conduct described in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv), or 1227(a)(4)(A)(i), or an egregious public safety offense.Q77: Does deferred action provide a path to permanent resident status (a Green Card) or citizenship?A77: No. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion that does not confer lawful permanent resident status or a path to citizenship. Only Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.Q78: Can I be considered for deferred action even if I do not meet the guidelines to be considered for DACA?A78: The process at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is only for individuals who meet the specific guidelines for DACA. Other individuals may, on a case-by-case basis, request deferred action from USCIS or ICE in certain circumstances, consistent with longstanding practice.Q79: How will ICE and USCIS handle cases involving individuals who do not satisfy the guidelines of this process but believe they may otherwise warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion?A79: If we find that you do not satisfy the DACA guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b) or otherwise determines you do not warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, then we will decline to defer action in your case. If you are currently in removal proceedings, have a final order, or have a voluntary departure order, you may then request ICE consider whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Guidance on requests to ICE for prosecutorial discretion is available at ICE’s Prosecutorial Discretion webpage.Q80: How should I fill out question 9 on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization?A80. When you are filing a Form I-765 as part of a DACA request, question 9 is asking you to list those Social Security numbers that were officially issued to you by the Social Security Administration.Q81: Is there supervisory review of decisions by USCIS under this process?A81: Yes. We have implemented a successful supervisory review process to ensure a consistent process for considering requests for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q82: Do USCIS personnel responsible for reviewing requests for DACA receive special training?A82: Yes. USCIS personnel responsible for considering requests for consideration of DACA have received special training.Q83: Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at group assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS?A83: Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 292.3 and 1003.102, practitioners are required to file Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, when they engage in practice in immigration matters before DHS, either in person or through the preparation or filing of any brief, application, petition, or other document. Under these rules, a practitioner who consistently violates the requirement to file a Form G-28 may be subject to disciplinary sanctions; however, on Feb. 28, 2011, we issued a statement indicating that we do not intend to initiate disciplinary proceedings against practitioners (attorneys and accredited representatives) based solely on the failure to submit a Form G-28 in relation to pro bono services provided at group assistance events. DHS is in the process of issuing a final rule, at which time this matter will be reevaluated.Q84: When must an individual sign a Form I-821D as a preparer?A84: Anytime someone other than the requestor prepares or helps fill out the Form I-821D, that individual must complete Part 5 of the form.Q85: If I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for consideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company?A85: You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting DACA with documentation which verifies their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment) unless there is evidence of egregious violations of criminal statutes or widespread abuses.Q86: Can I request consideration for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 if I live in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)?A86: Yes, in certain circumstances. The CNMI is part of the United States for immigration purposes and is not excluded from this process. However, because of the specific guidelines for consideration of DACA, individuals who have been residents of the CNMI are in most cases unlikely to meet the criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b). You must, among other things, have come to the United States before your 16th birthday and have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007.Under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, the CNMI became part of the United States for purposes of immigration law only on Nov. 28, 2009. Therefore, entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or residence in, the United States for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b).We have used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address humanitarian needs on a case-by-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action under this process, except that your entry or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before Nov. 28, 2009, we are willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole. If this situation applies to you, you should make an appointment  in Saipan to discuss your case with an immigration officer.Q87: Will USCIS expedite the processing of my pending DACA request?A87: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within our sole discretion. Please visit the USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitions for more information and guidance on expedite requests.Evidence showing the humanitarian need for expediting your DACA request may include, but is not limited to, evidence of loss of employment, disenrollment from an educational program, or medical or health-related emergencies.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal requests between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires to minimize the risk of your DACA lapsing.Q88: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my DACA request. Is this true?A88: No. While practitioners may charge a fee for preparation of your DACA request, including a request to expedite, an attorney or accredited representative who guarantees faster processing by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you and take your money. Visit our Avoid Scams page to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams.Although you may request that USCIS expedite processing of your DACA request, there is no fee to request expedited processing. Make sure you seek information about requests for consideration of DACA from official government sources such as USCIS or DHS. If you are seeking legal advice, visit our Find Legal Services page to learn how to choose a licensed attorney or accredited representative.Q89: Am I required to register with the Selective Service?A89:  Most male persons residing in the United States, who are ages 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service. Visit the Selective Service System website for more information.Q90: How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a DACA recipient?A90: An employer may be engaging in discrimination if they:Demand that an employee show specific documents or ask for more or different documents than are required to complete Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, or create an E-Verify case; orReject documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents that reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, including documentation showing work authorization because it has a future expiration date or because of an employee’s prior unauthorized status.The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not discriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the United States. These include DACA recipients who have been granted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-237-2515).For more information about unfair employment practices against DACA recipients, please read IER’s factsheet in English  (PDF) or Spanish  (PDF).For additional resources and information about workers’ rights, visit the Department of Justice Reminders for DACA Recipients and Employers webpage.Return to top.",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Q1: What is deferred action?",
          "answer": "A1: Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. For purposes of future inadmissibility based on prior periods ofunlawful presencein the United States, an individual is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period when deferred action is in effect. An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.  Deferred action recipients are also considered to belawfully presentas described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi) for purposes of eligibility for certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) during the period of deferred action. However, deferred action does not conferlawful immigration statusupon an individual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence they may have. Under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33), an individual who has been granted deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21 through 236.23, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, may receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action, provided they can demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.” Under 8 CFR 236.23(d), we may terminate a grant of DACA at any time, at the agency’s discretion. Please see Q28 for more information. Q2: What is DACA?A2: On June 15, 2012, the secretary of homeland security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several key guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal, and, if approved, will then be eligible for work authorization if they can demonstrate economic necessity. On Aug. 30, 2022, DHS issued theDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Final Ruleto preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum. The final rule is effective as of Oct. 31, 2022. Individuals who can demonstrate through verifiable documentation that they meet these guidelines will be considered for deferred action. We will make determinations on a case-by-case basis under the DACA final rule. All guidance in these FAQs stems from the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q3: I currently have DACA. How does the DACA Final Rule impact me?A3: If you are a current DACA recipient, your grant of deferred action and related work authorization, as well as any DACA advance parole document issued, will remain in effect and will expire according to their existing terms. Any requests for renewals of those grants are now governed by the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 and not the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum. Q4: Is there any difference between “deferred action” and DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A4: DACA is a form of deferred action. The relief an individual receives with a grant of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is identical for immigration purposes to the relief obtained by any person who receives deferred action as an act of prosecutorial discretion. Q5: If my removal is deferred under the DACA final rule, am I eligible for employment authorization?A5: Yes. Under the regulations at 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33) if you receive DACA under the DACA final rule, you may obtain employment authorization from USCIS provided you can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Q6: If my case is deferred, am I in lawful status for the period of deferral?A6: No. Although action on your case has been deferred and you do not accrue unlawful presence (for admissibility purposes) during the period of deferred action, deferred action does not confer any lawful immigration status. The fact that you are not accruing unlawful presence does not change that you are in unlawful status while you remain in the United States. However, although deferred action does not confer a lawful immigration status, you may stay in the United States while your deferred action is in effect. For admissibility purposes, you will not accrue “unlawful presence” while you have deferred action. You are also considered to be “lawfully present” in the United States while you have deferred action for purposes of certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) as described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi). Federal law does not prevent individuals granted deferred action from establishing domicile in the United States. Apart from the immigration laws, “lawful presence,” “lawful status” and similar terms are used in various other federal and state laws. For information on how those laws affect individuals who receive a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA, please contact the appropriate federal, state, or local authorities. Note: It is a federal crime for an alien who is “illegally or unlawfully in the United States,” among others, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. See 18 U.S. 922(g)(5)(A). This prohibition applies to DACA recipients. Q7: Can I renew my period of deferred action and employment authorization under DACA?A7: Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of your DACA. We will consider your request for a renewal on a case-by-case basis under 8 CFR 236.22-23. If we renew our exercise of discretion under DACA for your case, you will receive deferred action for another 2 years, and if you show an economic necessity for employment, you may receive employment authorization for that period.

Q4: Is there any difference between “deferred action” and DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A4: DACA is a form of deferred action. The relief an individual receives with a grant of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is identical for immigration purposes to the relief obtained by any person who receives deferred action as an act of prosecutorial discretion. Q5: If my removal is deferred under the DACA final rule, am I eligible for employment authorization?A5: Yes. Under the regulations at 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33) if you receive DACA under the DACA final rule, you may obtain employment authorization from USCIS provided you can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Q6: If my case is deferred, am I in lawful status for the period of deferral?A6: No. Although action on your case has been deferred and you do not accrue unlawful presence (for admissibility purposes) during the period of deferred action, deferred action does not confer any lawful immigration status. The fact that you are not accruing unlawful presence does not change that you are in unlawful status while you remain in the United States. However, although deferred action does not confer a lawful immigration status, you may stay in the United States while your deferred action is in effect. For admissibility purposes, you will not accrue “unlawful presence” while you have deferred action. You are also considered to be “lawfully present” in the United States while you have deferred action for purposes of certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) as described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi). Federal law does not prevent individuals granted deferred action from establishing domicile in the United States. Apart from the immigration laws, “lawful presence,” “lawful status” and similar terms are used in various other federal and state laws. For information on how those laws affect individuals who receive a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA, please contact the appropriate federal, state, or local authorities. Note: It is a federal crime for an alien who is “illegally or unlawfully in the United States,” among others, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. See 18 U.S. 922(g)(5)(A). This prohibition applies to DACA recipients. Q7: Can I renew my period of deferred action and employment authorization under DACA?A7: Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of your DACA. We will consider your request for a renewal on a case-by-case basis under 8 CFR 236.22-23. If we renew our exercise of discretion under DACA for your case, you will receive deferred action for another 2 years, and if you show an economic necessity for employment, you may receive employment authorization for that period.

Q12: If I am not in removal proceedings but believe I meet the guidelines for consideration of DACA, should I seek to place myself into removal proceedings through encounters with CBP or ICE?A12: No. If you are not in removal proceedings but believe that you meet the guidelines for DACA consideration under 8 CFR 236.21 – 236.25, you should submit your DACA request to USCIS under the process outlined below and at 8 CFR 236.23. Q13: Can I request consideration of DACA from USCIS if I am in immigration detention under the custody of ICE?A13: Yes. If you are currently in immigration detention, you may request consideration of DACA from USCIS. However, if we decide to grant you DACA, we will not approve your DACA request until you are released from detention. If you are requesting DACA, you should tell your deportation officer. Q14: If I am about to be removed by ICE and believe that I meet the guidelines for consideration of DACA, what should I do to seek review of my case before removal?A14: If you believe you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines and are about to be removed, you should immediately contact your case officer or the ICE Detention Reporting and Information Line at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Eastern, Monday – Friday) or emailERO.INFO@ice.dhs.gov. Q15: What should I do if I meet the guidelines of this process and have been issued an ICE detainer following an arrest by a state or local law enforcement officer?A15: If you meet the guidelines and have been served a detainer, you should immediately contact the ICE Detention Reporting and Information Line at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Eastern, Monday–Friday); or emailERO.INFO@ice.dhs.gov Q16: If I accepted an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process or my case was terminated or dismissed as part of the case-by-case review process, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?A16: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of DACA even if you have accepted an offer of administrative closure or termination under the case-by-case review process. Q17: If I declined an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?A17: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of DACA even if you declined an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process. Q18: If my case was reviewed as part of the case-by-case review process but I was not offered administrative closure, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?A18: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of DACA even if you were not offered administrative closure following review of your case as part of the case-by-case review process. Q19: Can I request renewal of DACA if I am in a nonimmigrant status (for example F-1, E-2, H-4) or have Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or parole at the time I submit my request?A19: No. You can only request renewal of DACA if, at the time you submit your request and at the time we adjudicate your request, you have no immigration status or parole and were not in any lawful status or parole on June 15, 2012. However, a pending petition or application for nonimmigrant status, TPS, or parole does not prevent you from renewing DACA, if you otherwise meet the threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22. Q20. I am a DACA recipient, and I have been granted parole in place. Can I renew my DACA?A20. No. If you are in a valid period of parole, including if you have an approvedForm I-131F, Application for Parole in Place for Certain Noncitizen Spouses and Stepchildren of U.S. Citizens,andthe grant of parole in place is still valid, we will not renew your DACA. You can only request consideration of DACA if, both when you submit your request and when we adjudicate your request, you have no parole or lawful immigration status. However, apendingrequest for parole in place does not prevent you from renewing DACA, if you otherwise meet the threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22. Q21: Will the information I share in my request for consideration of DACA be used for immigration enforcement purposes?A21: Under 8 CFR 236.23(e)(1), DHS will not use information about a requestor in a request for DACA to initiate immigration enforcement proceedings against that requestor, unless DHS is initiating immigration enforcement proceedings due to a criminal offense, fraud, a threat to national security, or public safety concerns. Individuals whose cases are deferred under DACA will not be referred to ICE. The information may be shared with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or to investigate or prosecute a criminal offense. Q22: If my case is referred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes or if I receive a Notice to Appear, will ICE receive information about my family members and guardians for immigration enforcement purposes?A22: Under 8 CFR § 236.23(e)(2), information contained in your DACA request related to your family members or guardians will not be used for immigration enforcement purposes against them. However, we may share this information with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.

Therefore, if you called a customer service representative to change your address, please be sure you also change your address online or with a Form AR-11.Denied the request on the grounds that you did not come to the United States before your 16th birthday, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you did arrive before reaching that age.Denied the request on the grounds that you were under age 15 at the time of filing but not in removal proceedings, while the evidence submitted at the time of filing show that you indeed were in removal proceedings when the request was filed;Denied the request on the grounds that you were 31 or older as of June 15, 2012, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012;Denied the request on the grounds that you had lawful status on June 15, 2012, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you indeed were in an unlawful immigration status on that date;Denied the request on the grounds that you were not physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and up through the date of filing, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you were, in fact, present;Denied on the grounds that you are not currently in school, have not graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have not obtained a GED certificate, and are not an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States;Denied the request due to your failure to appear at a USCIS ASC where we may collect your biometrics, when you in fact either did appear at a USCIS ASC to have this done or requested before the scheduled date of your biometrics appointment to have the appointment rescheduled; orDenied the request because you did not pay the filing fees for Form I-821D or Form I-765 when you actually did pay these fees. Q28: If USCIS does not exercise deferred action in my case, will I be placed in removal proceedings?A28: If we deny your request for DACA under 8 CFR 236.23, we will not issue a Notice to Appear or refer your case to ICE for possible enforcement action based on our denial, unless we determine that your case involves denial for a criminal offense, fraud, a threat to national security, or public safety concerns. We may consider factors including, but not limited to, whether a misrepresentation is willful, material, and knowing in determining whether fraud is involved in a case. Q29: Can USCIS terminate my DACA before it expires?A29: Yes. DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and under 8 CFR 236.23(d), we may terminate a grant of DACA at any time, at USCIS’ discretion. We will provide a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) and an opportunity to respond before terminating a DACA grant, except we may terminate a grant of DACA without an NOIT and an opportunity to respond if you are convicted of a national security-related offense involving conduct described in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), (iv), or 1227(a)(4)(A)(i)), or an egregious public safety offense.

          "question": "Q31: What guidelines must I meet to be considered for DACA?",
          "answer": "A31: Under current court orders, we are accepting, but not adjudicating, initial requests for DACA. Under 8 CFR 236.22, to be considered for DACA you must submit evidence, including supporting documents, showing that you: Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981);Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up until you filed your request for DACA;Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and when you filed your request for DACA with USCIS;Had no lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012,* and when you filed your request for DACA, meaning that: You never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012, orAny lawful immigration status or parole that you had before June 15, 2012, expired as of June 15, 2012, andAny lawful status that you had after June 15, 2012, expired or otherwise ended before you submitted your request for DACA; Are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. We consider on a case-by-case basis deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Even if you meet the threshold criteria listed above and at 8 CFR 236.22(b), we retain the discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that any specific factor makes deferred action inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22(c). * Please review Q19 if you are currently in a lawful immigration status. Q32: I first came to the United States before I turned 16 years old, and I have been continuously residing in the United States since at least June 15, 2007. Before I turned 16 years old, however, I left the United States for some period before returning and beginning my current period of continuous residence. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A32: Yes, but only if you established residence in the United States during the period before you turned 16 years old, as evidenced, for example, by records showing you attended school or worked in the United States during that time, or that you lived in the United States for multiple years during that time. In addition to establishing that you initially resided in the United States before you turned 16 years old, you must also have maintained continuous residence in the United States from June 15, 2007, until the present time to be considered for deferred action under this process. See 8 CFR 236.22(b)(1)-(2). Q33: To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence documenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period?A33: To meet the continuous residence guideline under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(2), you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the United States from June 15, 2007, up until the time of filing your request. You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence. It is helpful for us if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the United States for the period since June 15, 2007. Gaps in the documentation for certain periods may raise doubts about your continued residence if they are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been outside the United States for a period that was not brief, casual or innocent. If gaps in your documentation raise questions, we may issue a Request for Evidence(RFE) to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous residence. You may submit affidavits to explain a gap in the documentation showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement. If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances during the period when there is a gap in the documentation. You may only use affidavits to explain gaps in your continuous residence; you cannot use them as evidence that you meet the entire 5-year continuous residence requirement. Q34: I came to the United States when I was very young and before I began attending school, so I do not have primary evidence of the start of my continuous residence in the United States. Can I submit an affidavit as proof of the start of my continuous residence period?A34: DHS will accept affidavits for the start of the continuous residence period if you are a new initial requestor who arrived in the United States at or before age 8. We recognize that age 8 is the highest age at which school attendance becomes required within the United States, and that it may be more challenging for individuals who arrived before that age to provide primary evidence of the start of their continuous residence period. Q35: Does “currently enrolled in school” refer to the date when I file the request for consideration of deferred action?A35: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in school on the date you submit a DACA request. Q36: Who is considered to be “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A36: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in: A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements;An education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; orAn education program helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) in the United States. Education, literacy, and career training programs (including vocational training), or education programs helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law, or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam in the United States, may include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations. Programs funded by other sources may qualify if they have demonstrated effectiveness. In assessing whether programs are of demonstrated effectiveness, we will consider: The duration of the program’s existence;The program’s track record in:Assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent;Passing a GED or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC); orPlacing students in postsecondary education, job training, or employment; andOther indicators of the program’s overall quality. If you seek to demonstrate that you are “currently enrolled in school” with your enrollment in such a program, you must show the program’s demonstrated effectiveness. Q37: How do I establish that I am currently enrolled in school?A37: Documentation showing that you are enrolled in school may include evidence that you are enrolled in: A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school or secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements; orAn education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that:Has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English, or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; andIs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness; orAn education program assisting students in obtaining a high school equivalency diploma or certificate recognized under state law (such as by passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), and that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness. Evidence of enrollment may include acceptance letters, school registration cards, letters from a school or program, transcripts, report cards, or progress reports that may show the name of the school or program, date of enrollment, and current educational or grade level, if relevant. See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents.Q38: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school?A38: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation showing that you have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to: A high school diploma from a public or private high school or secondary school; orA certificate of completion, a certificate of attendance, or an alternate award from a public or private high school or secondary school or a recognized equivalent of a high school diploma under state law, or a GED certificate or certificate from passing another such state authorized exam (e.g., HiSet or TASC) in the United States. Q39: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC)?A39: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation demonstrating that you have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to, evidence that you have passed a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) and received the recognized equivalent of a regular high school diploma under state law. Q40: If I am enrolled in a literacy or career training program, can I meet the guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A40: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) if you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. Such programs include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or if funded by other sources, are programs of demonstrated effectiveness. Q41: If I am enrolled in an English as a second language (ESL) program, can I meet the guidelines?A41: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) through enrollment in an ESL program if the ESL program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or is a program of demonstrated effectiveness. You must submit direct documentary evidence that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants, administered by a nonprofit organization, or of demonstrated effectiveness. Q42: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A42: No. We will not accept evidence that is not listed in Chart #1 to establish that you are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a GED or passed another state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5). You must submit any of the documentary evidence listed in Chart #1 to show that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5). Q43: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met certain threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?A43: You may use evidence other than those documents listed in Chart #1 to establish that you meet the following guidelines and factual showings, if available documentary evidence is insufficient or lacking and shows that: You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You satisfy the continuous residence requirement, if you present direct evidence of your continued residence in the United States for a portion of the required period and the circumstantial evidence is used only to fill in gaps in the length of continuous residence demonstrated by the direct evidence; andAny travel outside the United States during the period of required continuous presence was brief, casual, and innocent. However, we will not accept evidence other than the documents listed in Chart #1 as proof that you meet any of the following guidelines: You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYou are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States. For example, even if you do not have documentary proof of your presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, you may still be able to demonstrate that you meet the guideline. You may do so by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in the United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which may be enough to infer you were present June 15, 2012, as well. However, we will not accept evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit the designated documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet this guideline. Chart #1 provides examples of documentation you may submit to demonstrate you meet the threshold criteria for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Please see the instructions forForm I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, for additional details of acceptable documentation."

However, we will not accept evidence other than the documents listed in Chart #1 as proof that you meet any of the following guidelines: You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYou are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States. For example, even if you do not have documentary proof of your presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, you may still be able to demonstrate that you meet the guideline. You may do so by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in the United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which may be enough to infer you were present June 15, 2012, as well. However, we will not accept evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit the designated documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet this guideline. Chart #1 provides examples of documentation you may submit to demonstrate you meet the threshold criteria for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.

          "question": "Q33: To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence documenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period?",
          "answer": "A33: To meet the continuous residence guideline under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(2), you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the United States from June 15, 2007, up until the time of filing your request. You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence. It is helpful for us if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the United States for the period since June 15, 2007. Gaps in the documentation for certain periods may raise doubts about your continued residence if they are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been outside the United States for a period that was not brief, casual or innocent. If gaps in your documentation raise questions, we may issue a Request for Evidence(RFE) to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous residence. You may submit affidavits to explain a gap in the documentation showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement. If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances during the period when there is a gap in the documentation. You may only use affidavits to explain gaps in your continuous residence; you cannot use them as evidence that you meet the entire 5-year continuous residence requirement. Q34: I came to the United States when I was very young and before I began attending school, so I do not have primary evidence of the start of my continuous residence in the United States. Can I submit an affidavit as proof of the start of my continuous residence period?A34: DHS will accept affidavits for the start of the continuous residence period if you are a new initial requestor who arrived in the United States at or before age 8. We recognize that age 8 is the highest age at which school attendance becomes required within the United States, and that it may be more challenging for individuals who arrived before that age to provide primary evidence of the start of their continuous residence period. Q35: Does “currently enrolled in school” refer to the date when I file the request for consideration of deferred action?A35: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in school on the date you submit a DACA request. Q36: Who is considered to be “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A36: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in: A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements;An education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; orAn education program helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) in the United States. Education, literacy, and career training programs (including vocational training), or education programs helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law, or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam in the United States, may include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations. Programs funded by other sources may qualify if they have demonstrated effectiveness. In assessing whether programs are of demonstrated effectiveness, we will consider: The duration of the program’s existence;The program’s track record in:Assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent;Passing a GED or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC); orPlacing students in postsecondary education, job training, or employment; andOther indicators of the program’s overall quality. If you seek to demonstrate that you are “currently enrolled in school” with your enrollment in such a program, you must show the program’s demonstrated effectiveness. Q37: How do I establish that I am currently enrolled in school?A37: Documentation showing that you are enrolled in school may include evidence that you are enrolled in: A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school or secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements; orAn education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that:Has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English, or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; andIs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness; orAn education program assisting students in obtaining a high school equivalency diploma or certificate recognized under state law (such as by passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), and that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness. Evidence of enrollment may include acceptance letters, school registration cards, letters from a school or program, transcripts, report cards, or progress reports that may show the name of the school or program, date of enrollment, and current educational or grade level, if relevant. See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents.Q38: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school?A38: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation showing that you have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to: A high school diploma from a public or private high school or secondary school; orA certificate of completion, a certificate of attendance, or an alternate award from a public or private high school or secondary school or a recognized equivalent of a high school diploma under state law, or a GED certificate or certificate from passing another such state authorized exam (e.g., HiSet or TASC) in the United States. Q39: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC)?A39: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation demonstrating that you have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to, evidence that you have passed a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) and received the recognized equivalent of a regular high school diploma under state law. Q40: If I am enrolled in a literacy or career training program, can I meet the guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A40: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) if you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. Such programs include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or if funded by other sources, are programs of demonstrated effectiveness. Q41: If I am enrolled in an English as a second language (ESL) program, can I meet the guidelines?A41: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) through enrollment in an ESL program if the ESL program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or is a program of demonstrated effectiveness. You must submit direct documentary evidence that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants, administered by a nonprofit organization, or of demonstrated effectiveness. Q42: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A42: No. We will not accept evidence that is not listed in Chart #1 to establish that you are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a GED or passed another state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5).

          "answer": "A42: No. We will not accept evidence that is not listed in Chart #1 to establish that you are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a GED or passed another state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5). You must submit any of the documentary evidence listed in Chart #1 to show that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5). Q43: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met certain threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?A43: You may use evidence other than those documents listed in Chart #1 to establish that you meet the following guidelines and factual showings, if available documentary evidence is insufficient or lacking and shows that: You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You satisfy the continuous residence requirement, if you present direct evidence of your continued residence in the United States for a portion of the required period and the circumstantial evidence is used only to fill in gaps in the length of continuous residence demonstrated by the direct evidence; andAny travel outside the United States during the period of required continuous presence was brief, casual, and innocent. However, we will not accept evidence other than the documents listed in Chart #1 as proof that you meet any of the following guidelines: You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYou are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States. For example, even if you do not have documentary proof of your presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, you may still be able to demonstrate that you meet the guideline. You may do so by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in the United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which may be enough to infer you were present June 15, 2012, as well. However, we will not accept evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit the designated documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet this guideline. Chart #1 provides examples of documentation you may submit to demonstrate you meet the threshold criteria for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.

          "question": "Q44: May I file affidavits as proof that I meet the threshold criteria for consideration of DACA at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?",
          "answer": "A44: Affidavits generally will not be sufficient on their own to demonstrate that you meet the threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b) for us to consider you for DACA. However, you may use affidavits to support meeting the following guidelines if the documentary evidence available to you is insufficient or lacking: Showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement;Establishing the start of the continuous residence period if you entered the United States before age 8; andEstablishing that departures during the required period of continuous residence were brief, casual, and innocent. If you submit affidavits related to the above criteria, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself, who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances. If we determine that the affidavits are insufficient to overcome the unavailability or lack of documentary evidence with respect to either of these guidelines, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating you must submit further evidence to demonstrate that you meet these guidelines.We will not accept affidavits to satisfy the following guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b): You are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion or other alternate award from high school, have obtained a high school equivalency diploma or certificate (such as by passing the GED exam or other similar state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), or are an honorably discharged veteran from the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States;You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYour lack of disqualifying criminal history. If the only evidence you submit to demonstrate you meet any of the above guidelines is an affidavit, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating that you have not demonstrated that you meet these guidelines and that you must submit evidence to demonstrate that you meet that guideline. Q45: Can I be considered for deferred action under this process if I had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal pending before either USCIS or the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on June 15, 2012?A45: Yes. If you had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal, or similar relief, pending before either USCIS or EOIR as of June 15, 2012, but had no lawful status, you may request consideration of DACA. Q46: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I violated my immigration status (for example, by engaging in unauthorized employment, failing to report to my employer, or failing to pursue a full course of study) before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A46: No, unless the Executive Office for Immigration Review terminated your status by issuing a final order of removal against you before June 15, 2012. Q47: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I \"aged out\" of my dependent nonimmigrant status as of June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A47: Yes. For purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,\" guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if you were admitted for duration of status or for a period of time that extended past June 14, 2012, but aged out of your dependent nonimmigrant status on or before June 15, 2012, (meaning you turned 21 years old on or before June 15, 2012), you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q48: I was admitted for duration of status, but my status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is listed as terminated on or before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A48: Yes. For the purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,” guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if your status as of June 15, 2012, is listed as “terminated” in SEVIS, you may be considered for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q49: I am a Canadian citizen who was inspected by CBP but was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A49: In general, a Canadian citizen who was admitted as a visitor for business or pleasure and not issued a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record (also known as a “non-controlled” Canadian nonimmigrant) is lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. For that reason, unless there is evidence, including verifiable evidence provided by the individual, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time, DHS will consider, for purposes of 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 only, that the alien was lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. If DHS can verify from its records that your last noncontrolled entry occurred on or before Dec. 14, 2011, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q50: I used my Border Crossing Card (BCC) to obtain admission to the United States and was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A50: Because the limitations on entry for a BCC holder vary based on location of admission and travel, DHS will assume that the BCC holder who was not provided a Form I-94 was admitted for the longest period legally possible—30 days—unless the individual can demonstrate, through verifiable evidence, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time. Accordingly, if DHS is able to verify from its records that your last admission was using a BCC, you were not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission, and it occurred on or before May 14, 2012, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q51: Do I accrue unlawful presence if I have a pending initial request for consideration of DACA?A51: You will continue to accrue unlawful presence while the request for consideration of DACA is pending unless you are under 18 years of age at the time of the request. If you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your request, you will not accrue unlawful presence while the request is pending, even if you turn 18 while your request is pending with USCIS. If we grant your DACA request, you will not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action. However, having deferred action will not excuse previously accrued unlawful presence.

For that reason, unless there is evidence, including verifiable evidence provided by the individual, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time, DHS will consider, for purposes of 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 only, that the alien was lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. If DHS can verify from its records that your last noncontrolled entry occurred on or before Dec. 14, 2011, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q50: I used my Border Crossing Card (BCC) to obtain admission to the United States and was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A50: Because the limitations on entry for a BCC holder vary based on location of admission and travel, DHS will assume that the BCC holder who was not provided a Form I-94 was admitted for the longest period legally possible—30 days—unless the individual can demonstrate, through verifiable evidence, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time. Accordingly, if DHS is able to verify from its records that your last admission was using a BCC, you were not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission, and it occurred on or before May 14, 2012, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q51: Do I accrue unlawful presence if I have a pending initial request for consideration of DACA?A51: You will continue to accrue unlawful presence while the request for consideration of DACA is pending unless you are under 18 years of age at the time of the request. If you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your request, you will not accrue unlawful presence while the request is pending, even if you turn 18 while your request is pending with USCIS. If we grant your DACA request, you will not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action. However, having deferred action will not excuse previously accrued unlawful presence.

          "question": "Q52: When should I file my DACA renewal request?",
          "answer": "A52: We strongly encourage you to submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice and EAD. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision. DACA recipients may submit a DACA renewal request online. To file Form I-821D and Form I-765 online, a DACA requestor must first create a USCIS online account, which provides a convenient and secure method to submit forms, pay fees and track the status of any pending USCIS immigration request throughout the adjudication process. There is no cost to set up an account, which offers a variety of features, including the ability to communicate with USCIS through a secure inbox and respond online to Requests for Evidence. For additional information on filing a DACA renewal request online, go to theForm I-821Dwebpage. All online DACA renewal requests must include Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS and accompanying fees. USCIS’ current goal is to process DACA renewal requests within 120 days. You maysubmit an inquiry onlineabout the status of your renewal request after it has been pending more than 105 days. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to:If you fail to appear at an ASC for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. It will take longer to process your request if you miss or reschedule your appointments;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orA renewal submission that is incomplete or contains evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines and we must request additional evidence or an explanation. Q53: Can I file a renewal request outside the recommended filing period of 120 to 150 days before my current DACA expires?A53: We strongly encourages you to file your renewal request within the recommended 120- to 150-day filing period to minimize the possibility that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. We will accept requests we receive earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expires; however, this could result in an overlap between your current DACA and your renewal. This means your renewal period may extend for less than a full 2 years from the date that your current DACA period expires. If you file less than 120 days before your current period of DACA expires, there is more risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. If you file after your most recent DACA period expires, but within 1 year of its expiration, you may submit a request to renew your DACA. If you are filing beyond 1 year after your most recent period of DACA expired, or if your most recent grant of DACA was terminated at any time, you may still request DACA by submitting a new initial request. Please note: An ongoingJuly 16, 2021, injunctionfrom the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and, on Oct. 14, 2022, was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect and prohibits DHS from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule. Due to the partial stay of the injunction, DHS presently may grant DACA renewal requests under the final rule. Q54: How will USCIS evaluate my request for renewal of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A54: We may consider renewing your DACA if you met the guidelines for consideration of Initial DACA (see above and 8 CFR 236.22(b)) and you: Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012;Have continuously resided in the United States since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved up to the present time; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. These guidelines must be met for consideration of DACA renewal. We consider deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 on a case-by-case basis. Even if you meet the guidelines, we have discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that deferred action is inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22I. Q55. Do I accrue unlawful presence if I am seeking renewal and my previous period of DACA expires before I receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA? Similarly, what would happen to my work authorization?A55: Yes, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will accrue unlawful presence for any time between the periods of deferred action, unless you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your renewal request. Similarly, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will not be authorized to work in the United States regardless of your age at time of filing until and unless you receive a new EAD from USCIS. Q56. Do I need to provide additional documents when I request renewal of deferred action under DACA?A56. No, unless you have new documents pertaining to removal proceedings or criminal history that you have not already submitted to USCIS in a previously approved DACA request. However, we reserve the authority, at our discretion, to request additional documents, information or statements relating to a DACA renewal request determination. CAUTION: If you knowingly and willfully provide materially false information on Form I-821D, you will be committing a federal felony punishable by a fine, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. In addition, you may be placed into removal proceedings, face severe penalties provided by law, and be subject to criminal prosecution. Q57.; If I am no longer enrolled in school, can I still request to renew my DACA?A57. Yes. Neither Form I-821D nor the instructions ask renewal requestors for information about continued school enrollment or graduation. The instructions for renewal requests specify that you may be considered for DACA renewal if you met the guidelines for consideration of initial DACA, including the educational guidelines and: Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without advance parole;Have continuously resided in the United States, up to the present time, since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)or 3 or more other misdemeanors and are not a threat to national security or public safety. Q58. If I initially received DACA and was under age 31 on June 15, 2012, but have since become 31 or older, can I still request renewal of DACA?A58. Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of DACA as long as you were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012. "

          "question": "Q59: May I travel outside the United States before I submit an initial DACA request or while my initial DACA request is pending with USCIS?",
          "answer": "A59: Any unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt your continuous residence, and you will not be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. We will assess any travel outside of the United States that occurred on or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012, to determine whether the travel qualifies as brief, casual and innocent. (See Chart #2.) CAUTION: You should be aware that if you have been ordered deported or removed, and you then leave the United States, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. Q60: As a DACA recipient, can I travel outside of the United States?A60: Not automatically. If you want to travel outside the United States after receiving DACA, you must apply for an advance parole document by filingForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and paying the applicable fee. We will determine whether your purpose for international travel is justifiable based on the circumstances you describe in your request. Generally, we will only issue an advance parole document if you want to travel outside the United States for: Humanitarian purposes, including to obtain medical treatment, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit an ailing relative;Educational purposes, such as semester abroad programs and academic research; orEmployment purposes, including but not limited to overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or training, consular appointment for an employer-sponsored nonimmigrant visa, or meetings with clients overseas. Travel for vacation is not a valid basis for advance parole. Travel for educational purposes means travel affiliated with an institution that provides education as its primary purpose. You do not have to be enrolled in the institution that the program is affiliated with, but you must be enrolled in the program you will be traveling with. You may not apply for an advance parole document unless and until we approve your DACA request. If you are submitting a DACA renewal request, you may apply for advance parole at the same time; however, there is a separate filing address for advance parole requests, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will consider all advance parole requests on a case-by-case basis. We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131. If we have granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 after you have been ordered deported or removed, you may still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above. CAUTION: If you have been ordered deported or removed, before you leave the United States, you should seek to reopen your case before the EOIR and obtain administrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding. Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you should not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or removed, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, you may be considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. If you have any questions about this process, you may contact ICE through the local ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor with jurisdiction over your case. Q61: What happens to my DACA grant if I leave the United States without advance parole?A61: CAUTION: When you leave the United States, you are no longer in a period of deferred action. DACA recipients who leave the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States. We strongly encourage you to obtain an advance parole document before you leave to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA. We may terminate a grant of DACA, in our discretion and after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond, for DACA recipients who depart from the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document and subsequently enter the United States without inspection. See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(2). Generally, a recent entry without inspection will be a significant negative factor warranting termination of DACA as a threat to border security, but where there are exigent circumstances, such as accidental or involuntary border crossings, DHS may choose to continue exercising prosecutorial discretion and allow the grant of deferred action to continue. DACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining advance parole but who are paroled into the United States may resume their DACA upon expiration of the period of parole. Q62: Why does my advance parole document show a 1-day parole period?A62: Your advance parole document may show a parole period of 1 day because it is to facilitate your reentry into the United States, at which time you will resume your current DACA validity period. This is different from the language on your advance parole document that authorizes a departure and reentry between specified dates. Please review your advance parole document carefully to understand the details of your travel authorization. Q63: Do brief departures from the United States interrupt the continuous residence requirement?A63: A brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt continuous residence, regardless of whether it was otherwise brief, casual, and innocent. Your absence from the United States will be considered brief, casual, and innocent if it was on or after June 15, 2007, and before Aug. 15, 2012, and: The absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure before you were placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings; andThe purpose of the absence and your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law. Once we have approved your request for DACA, you may fileForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States. CAUTION: If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without authorization and subsequently enter without inspection, DHS will issue you a Notice of Intent to Terminate and may, barring exigent circumstances, terminate your deferred action under DACA in its discretion,"

          "question": "Q60: As a DACA recipient, can I travel outside of the United States?",
          "answer": "A60: Not automatically. If you want to travel outside the United States after receiving DACA, you must apply for an advance parole document by filingForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and paying the applicable fee. We will determine whether your purpose for international travel is justifiable based on the circumstances you describe in your request. Generally, we will only issue an advance parole document if you want to travel outside the United States for: Humanitarian purposes, including to obtain medical treatment, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit an ailing relative;Educational purposes, such as semester abroad programs and academic research; orEmployment purposes, including but not limited to overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or training, consular appointment for an employer-sponsored nonimmigrant visa, or meetings with clients overseas. Travel for vacation is not a valid basis for advance parole. Travel for educational purposes means travel affiliated with an institution that provides education as its primary purpose. You do not have to be enrolled in the institution that the program is affiliated with, but you must be enrolled in the program you will be traveling with. You may not apply for an advance parole document unless and until we approve your DACA request. If you are submitting a DACA renewal request, you may apply for advance parole at the same time; however, there is a separate filing address for advance parole requests, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will consider all advance parole requests on a case-by-case basis. We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131. If we have granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 after you have been ordered deported or removed, you may still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above. CAUTION: If you have been ordered deported or removed, before you leave the United States, you should seek to reopen your case before the EOIR and obtain administrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding. Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you should not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or removed, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, you may be considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. If you have any questions about this process, you may contact ICE through the local ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor with jurisdiction over your case.

However, the filing addresses for a DACA renewal request and an advance parole request are different, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will not issue an advance parole document for a period that continues past your DACA validity period.

If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131. To request advance parole, you must submitForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. Please visit theForm I-131webpage before you begin the process to make sure you are using the current version of the form.

          "answer": "A67: No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, a misdemeanor offense described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct, we will not consider you for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q68: What offenses qualify as a felony?A68: A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year. A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of DACA. Q69: What offenses constitute disqualifying misdemeanors (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) for purposes of DACA?A69: For purposes of DACA, a misdemeanor (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) that meets the following criteria: Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; orIf not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE. A single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described above is disqualifying for purposes of DACA. A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Notwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of any misdemeanor convictions as described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion. Q70: What offenses constitute “other misdemeanors” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))?A70: For purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), an “other misdemeanor” is any misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater 5 days) that meets the following criteria: Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; andIs an offense for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE. Three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA. The decision to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors”  is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion. A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Q71: If I have a minor traffic offense, such as driving without a license, will it be considered a misdemeanor that counts towards the “3 or more other misdemeanors” and make me unable to receive consideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A71: We will not consider a minor traffic offense a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), and it is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we can consider your entire offense history along with other facts to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, you warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is important to emphasize that driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), regardless of the sentence imposed. Q72: What qualifies as a national security or public safety threat?A72: If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request for deferred action indicates that your presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security, we will not grant your DACA request. Indicators that you pose such a threat include, but are not limited to, gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States. Q73: Will offenses criminalized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws be considered disqualifying convictions for purpose of DACA?A73: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), convictions under state laws (including U.S. territories) for immigration-related offenses are not considered convictions for purposes of DACA. Q74: Will USCIS consider my expunged conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication as a disqualifying conviction for purposes of DACA?A74: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), we do not consider expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications disqualifying convictions for purposes of DACA. However, we will assess expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, under the circumstances, you present a national security or public safety concern and a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is otherwise warranted. If you were a juvenile, but tried and convicted as an adult, we will not consider your conviction a juvenile delinquency adjudication. Return to top."

          "answer": "A69: For purposes of DACA, a misdemeanor (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) that meets the following criteria: Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; orIf not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE. A single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described above is disqualifying for purposes of DACA. A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Notwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of any misdemeanor convictions as described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion. Q70: What offenses constitute “other misdemeanors” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))?A70: For purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), an “other misdemeanor” is any misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater 5 days) that meets the following criteria: Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; andIs an offense for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE. Three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA. The decision to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors”  is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion. A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Q71: If I have a minor traffic offense, such as driving without a license, will it be considered a misdemeanor that counts towards the “3 or more other misdemeanors” and make me unable to receive consideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A71: We will not consider a minor traffic offense a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), and it is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we can consider your entire offense history along with other facts to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, you warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is important to emphasize that driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), regardless of the sentence imposed. Q72: What qualifies as a national security or public safety threat?A72: If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request for deferred action indicates that your presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security, we will not grant your DACA request. Indicators that you pose such a threat include, but are not limited to, gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States. Q73: Will offenses criminalized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws be considered disqualifying convictions for purpose of DACA?A73: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), convictions under state laws (including U.S. territories) for immigration-related offenses are not considered convictions for purposes of DACA. Q74: Will USCIS consider my expunged conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication as a disqualifying conviction for purposes of DACA?A74: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), we do not consider expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications disqualifying convictions for purposes of DACA. However, we will assess expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, under the circumstances, you present a national security or public safety concern and a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is otherwise warranted. If you were a juvenile, but tried and convicted as an adult, we will not consider your conviction a juvenile delinquency adjudication. Return to top."

Submit the properly completed Form I-765, evidence that you are a current DACA recipient (such as your most recent DACA approval notice), and filing fee to thefiling addressfor the location where you live.

          "question": "Q76: Can USCIS terminate my DACA grant?",
          "answer": "A76: DHS may seek to terminate a grant of DACA at any time in its discretion. However, in most cases we will provide DACA recipients with a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT), with an opportunity to respond, before termination. We have discretion to terminate without providing a DACA recipient a NOIT and opportunity to respond if you were convicted of a national security-related offense involving conduct described in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv), or 1227(a)(4)(A)(i), or an egregious public safety offense. Q77: Does deferred action provide a path to permanent resident status (a Green Card) or citizenship?A77: No. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion that does not confer lawful permanent resident status or a path to citizenship. Only Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights. Q78: Can I be considered for deferred action even if I do not meet the guidelines to be considered for DACA?A78: The process at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is only for individuals who meet the specific guidelines for DACA. Other individuals may, on a case-by-case basis, request deferred action from USCIS or ICE in certain circumstances, consistent with longstanding practice. Q79: How will ICE and USCIS handle cases involving individuals who do not satisfy the guidelines of this process but believe they may otherwise warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion?A79: If we find that you do not satisfy the DACA guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b) or otherwise determines you do not warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, then we will decline to defer action in your case. If you are currently in removal proceedings, have a final order, or have a voluntary departure order, you may then request ICE consider whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Guidance on requests to ICE for prosecutorial discretion is available atICE’s Prosecutorial Discretion webpage. Q80: How should I fill out question 9 on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization?A80. When you are filing a Form I-765 as part of a DACA request, question 9 is asking you to list those Social Security numbers that were officially issued to you by the Social Security Administration. Q81: Is there supervisory review of decisions by USCIS under this process?A81: Yes. We have implemented a successful supervisory review process to ensure a consistent process for considering requests for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q82: Do USCIS personnel responsible for reviewing requests for DACA receive special training?A82: Yes. USCIS personnel responsible for considering requests for consideration of DACA have received special training. Q83: Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at group assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS?A83: Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 292.3 and 1003.102, practitioners are required to fileForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, when they engage in practice in immigration matters before DHS, either in person or through the preparation or filing of any brief, application, petition, or other document. Under these rules, a practitioner who consistently violates the requirement to file a Form G-28 may be subject to disciplinary sanctions; however, on Feb. 28, 2011, we issued a statement indicating that we do not intend to initiate disciplinary proceedings against practitioners (attorneys and accredited representatives) based solely on the failure to submit a Form G-28 in relation to pro bono services provided at group assistance events. DHS is in the process of issuing a final rule, at which time this matter will be reevaluated. Q84: When must an individual sign a Form I-821D as a preparer?A84: Anytime someone other than the requestor prepares or helps fill out the Form I-821D, that individual must complete Part 5 of the form. Q85: If I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for consideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company?A85: You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting DACA with documentation which verifies their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment) unless there is evidence of egregious violations of criminal statutes or widespread abuses. Q86: Can I request consideration for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 if I live in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)?A86: Yes, in certain circumstances. The CNMI is part of the United States for immigration purposes and is not excluded from this process. However, because of the specific guidelines for consideration of DACA, individuals who have been residents of the CNMI are in most cases unlikely to meet the criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b). You must, among other things, have come to the United States before your 16th birthday and have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007. Under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, the CNMI became part of the United States for purposes of immigration law only on Nov. 28, 2009. Therefore, entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or residence in, the United States for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b). We have used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address humanitarian needs on a case-by-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action under this process, except that your entry or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before Nov. 28, 2009, we are willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole. If this situation applies to you, you should make anappointmentin Saipan to discuss your case with an immigration officer. Q87: Will USCIS expedite the processing of my pending DACA request?A87: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within our sole discretion. Please visit theUSCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitionsfor more information and guidance on expedite requests. Evidence showing the humanitarian need for expediting your DACA request may include, but is not limited to, evidence of loss of employment, disenrollment from an educational program, or medical or health-related emergencies. We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal requests between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires to minimize the risk of your DACA lapsing. Q88: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my DACA request. Is this true?A88: No. While practitioners may charge a fee for preparation of your DACA request, including a request to expedite, an attorney or accredited representative who guarantees faster processing by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you and take your money. Visit ourAvoid Scamspage to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams. Although you mayrequest that USCIS expedite processingof your DACA request, there is no fee to request expedited processing. Make sure you seek information about requests for consideration of DACA from official government sources such as USCIS or DHS. If you are seeking legal advice, visit ourFind Legal Servicespage to learn how to choose a licensed attorney or accredited representative. Q89: Am I required to register with the Selective Service?A89:  Most male persons residing in the United States, who are ages 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service. Visit theSelective Service Systemwebsite for more information. Q90: How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a DACA recipient?A90: An employer may be engaging in discrimination if they: Demand that an employee show specific documents or ask for more or different documents than are required to completeForm I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, or create anE-Verifycase; orReject documents from theLists of Acceptable Documentsthat reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, including documentation showing work authorization because it has a future expiration date or because of an employee’s prior unauthorized status. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not discriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the United States. These include DACA recipients who have been granted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-237-2515).

          "question": "Q78: Can I be considered for deferred action even if I do not meet the guidelines to be considered for DACA?",
          "answer": "A78: The process at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is only for individuals who meet the specific guidelines for DACA. Other individuals may, on a case-by-case basis, request deferred action from USCIS or ICE in certain circumstances, consistent with longstanding practice. Q79: How will ICE and USCIS handle cases involving individuals who do not satisfy the guidelines of this process but believe they may otherwise warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion?A79: If we find that you do not satisfy the DACA guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b) or otherwise determines you do not warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, then we will decline to defer action in your case. If you are currently in removal proceedings, have a final order, or have a voluntary departure order, you may then request ICE consider whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Guidance on requests to ICE for prosecutorial discretion is available atICE’s Prosecutorial Discretion webpage. Q80: How should I fill out question 9 on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization?A80. When you are filing a Form I-765 as part of a DACA request, question 9 is asking you to list those Social Security numbers that were officially issued to you by the Social Security Administration. Q81: Is there supervisory review of decisions by USCIS under this process?A81: Yes. We have implemented a successful supervisory review process to ensure a consistent process for considering requests for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q82: Do USCIS personnel responsible for reviewing requests for DACA receive special training?A82: Yes. USCIS personnel responsible for considering requests for consideration of DACA have received special training. Q83: Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at group assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS?A83: Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 292.3 and 1003.102, practitioners are required to fileForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, when they engage in practice in immigration matters before DHS, either in person or through the preparation or filing of any brief, application, petition, or other document. Under these rules, a practitioner who consistently violates the requirement to file a Form G-28 may be subject to disciplinary sanctions; however, on Feb. 28, 2011, we issued a statement indicating that we do not intend to initiate disciplinary proceedings against practitioners (attorneys and accredited representatives) based solely on the failure to submit a Form G-28 in relation to pro bono services provided at group assistance events. DHS is in the process of issuing a final rule, at which time this matter will be reevaluated. Q84: When must an individual sign a Form I-821D as a preparer?A84: Anytime someone other than the requestor prepares or helps fill out the Form I-821D, that individual must complete Part 5 of the form. Q85: If I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for consideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company?A85: You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting DACA with documentation which verifies their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment) unless there is evidence of egregious violations of criminal statutes or widespread abuses. Q86: Can I request consideration for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 if I live in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)?A86: Yes, in certain circumstances. The CNMI is part of the United States for immigration purposes and is not excluded from this process. However, because of the specific guidelines for consideration of DACA, individuals who have been residents of the CNMI are in most cases unlikely to meet the criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b). You must, among other things, have come to the United States before your 16th birthday and have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007. Under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, the CNMI became part of the United States for purposes of immigration law only on Nov. 28, 2009. Therefore, entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or residence in, the United States for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b). We have used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address humanitarian needs on a case-by-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action under this process, except that your entry or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before Nov. 28, 2009, we are willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole. If this situation applies to you, you should make anappointmentin Saipan to discuss your case with an immigration officer. Q87: Will USCIS expedite the processing of my pending DACA request?A87: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within our sole discretion. Please visit theUSCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitionsfor more information and guidance on expedite requests. Evidence showing the humanitarian need for expediting your DACA request may include, but is not limited to, evidence of loss of employment, disenrollment from an educational program, or medical or health-related emergencies. We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal requests between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires to minimize the risk of your DACA lapsing. Q88: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my DACA request. Is this true?A88: No. While practitioners may charge a fee for preparation of your DACA request, including a request to expedite, an attorney or accredited representative who guarantees faster processing by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you and take your money. Visit ourAvoid Scamspage to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams. Although you mayrequest that USCIS expedite processingof your DACA request, there is no fee to request expedited processing.

Q85: If I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for consideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company?A85: You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting DACA with documentation which verifies their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment) unless there is evidence of egregious violations of criminal statutes or widespread abuses. Q86: Can I request consideration for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 if I live in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)?A86: Yes, in certain circumstances. The CNMI is part of the United States for immigration purposes and is not excluded from this process. However, because of the specific guidelines for consideration of DACA, individuals who have been residents of the CNMI are in most cases unlikely to meet the criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b). You must, among other things, have come to the United States before your 16th birthday and have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007. Under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, the CNMI became part of the United States for purposes of immigration law only on Nov. 28, 2009. Therefore, entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or residence in, the United States for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b). We have used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address humanitarian needs on a case-by-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action under this process, except that your entry or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before Nov. 28, 2009, we are willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole. If this situation applies to you, you should make anappointmentin Saipan to discuss your case with an immigration officer. Q87: Will USCIS expedite the processing of my pending DACA request?A87: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within our sole discretion. Please visit theUSCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitionsfor more information and guidance on expedite requests. Evidence showing the humanitarian need for expediting your DACA request may include, but is not limited to, evidence of loss of employment, disenrollment from an educational program, or medical or health-related emergencies. We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal requests between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires to minimize the risk of your DACA lapsing. Q88: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my DACA request. Is this true?A88: No. While practitioners may charge a fee for preparation of your DACA request, including a request to expedite, an attorney or accredited representative who guarantees faster processing by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you and take your money. Visit ourAvoid Scamspage to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams. Although you mayrequest that USCIS expedite processingof your DACA request, there is no fee to request expedited processing. Make sure you seek information about requests for consideration of DACA from official government sources such as USCIS or DHS.

Q89: Am I required to register with the Selective Service?A89:  Most male persons residing in the United States, who are ages 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service. Visit theSelective Service Systemwebsite for more information. Q90: How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a DACA recipient?A90: An employer may be engaging in discrimination if they: Demand that an employee show specific documents or ask for more or different documents than are required to completeForm I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, or create anE-Verifycase; orReject documents from theLists of Acceptable Documentsthat reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, including documentation showing work authorization because it has a future expiration date or because of an employee’s prior unauthorized status. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not discriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the United States. These include DACA recipients who have been granted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-237-2515).

          "question": "Q83: Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at group assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS?",
          "answer": "A83: Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 292.3 and 1003.102, practitioners are required to fileForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, when they engage in practice in immigration matters before DHS, either in person or through the preparation or filing of any brief, application, petition, or other document. Under these rules, a practitioner who consistently violates the requirement to file a Form G-28 may be subject to disciplinary sanctions; however, on Feb. 28, 2011, we issued a statement indicating that we do not intend to initiate disciplinary proceedings against practitioners (attorneys and accredited representatives) based solely on the failure to submit a Form G-28 in relation to pro bono services provided at group assistance events.

          "question": "A. What Is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals?",
          "answer": "As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to focus its enforcement resources on those who pose the greatest threat to homeland security, DHS will exercise prosecutorial discretion as appropriate to ensure that enforcement resources are not expended on individuals who do not fall into this category, such as individuals who came to the United States as children and meet other key guidelines. Individuals who demonstrate that they meet the guidelines below may request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal for a period of 2 years, and may be eligible for employment authorization. We may approve a request for DACA only if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you meet each of the following threshold criteria and merit a favorable exercise of discretion: Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981);Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the time of filing your request for DACA;Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time you filed your request for DACA with USCIS;Had no lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012, and at the time you filed your request for DACA, meaning that: You never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012*, orAny lawful immigration status or parole that you had before June 15, 2012, expired on or before June 15, 2012, andAny lawful status that you had after June 15, 2012, expired or otherwise terminated before you submitted your request for DACA; Are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. * Please review Q19 below if you are currently in a lawful immigration status. You may call us at 800-375-5283 with questions or to request more information on DACA.If you have a pending request, we haveonline self-help toolsyou can use to check your case status and processing times, change your address, and send an inquiry about a case pending longer than posted processing times or about non-delivery of a card or document. Q1: What is deferred action?A1: Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. For purposes of future inadmissibility based on prior periods ofunlawful presencein the United States, an individual is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period when deferred action is in effect. An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.  Deferred action recipients are also considered to belawfully presentas described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi) for purposes of eligibility for certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) during the period of deferred action. However, deferred action does not conferlawful immigration statusupon an individual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence they may have. Under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33), an individual who has been granted deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21 through 236.23, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, may receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action, provided they can demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.” Under 8 CFR 236.23(d), we may terminate a grant of DACA at any time, at the agency’s discretion. Please see Q28 for more information. Q2: What is DACA?A2: On June 15, 2012, the secretary of homeland security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several key guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal, and, if approved, will then be eligible for work authorization if they can demonstrate economic necessity. On Aug. 30, 2022, DHS issued theDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Final Ruleto preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum. The final rule is effective as of Oct. 31, 2022. Individuals who can demonstrate through verifiable documentation that they meet these guidelines will be considered for deferred action. We will make determinations on a case-by-case basis under the DACA final rule. All guidance in these FAQs stems from the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q3: I currently have DACA. How does the DACA Final Rule impact me?A3: If you are a current DACA recipient, your grant of deferred action and related work authorization, as well as any DACA advance parole document issued, will remain in effect and will expire according to their existing terms. Any requests for renewals of those grants are now governed by the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 and not the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum. Q4: Is there any difference between “deferred action” and DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A4: DACA is a form of deferred action. The relief an individual receives with a grant of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is identical for immigration purposes to the relief obtained by any person who receives deferred action as an act of prosecutorial discretion. Q5: If my removal is deferred under the DACA final rule, am I eligible for employment authorization?A5: Yes. Under the regulations at 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33) if you receive DACA under the DACA final rule, you may obtain employment authorization from USCIS provided you can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Q6: If my case is deferred, am I in lawful status for the period of deferral?A6: No. Although action on your case has been deferred and you do not accrue unlawful presence (for admissibility purposes) during the period of deferred action, deferred action does not confer any lawful immigration status. The fact that you are not accruing unlawful presence does not change that you are in unlawful status while you remain in the United States. However, although deferred action does not confer a lawful immigration status, you may stay in the United States while your deferred action is in effect. For admissibility purposes, you will not accrue “unlawful presence” while you have deferred action. You are also considered to be “lawfully present” in the United States while you have deferred action for purposes of certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) as described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi). Federal law does not prevent individuals granted deferred action from establishing domicile in the United States. Apart from the immigration laws, “lawful presence,” “lawful status” and similar terms are used in various other federal and state laws. For information on how those laws affect individuals who receive a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA, please contact the appropriate federal, state, or local authorities. Note: It is a federal crime for an alien who is “illegally or unlawfully in the United States,” among others, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. See 18 U.S. 922(g)(5)(A). This prohibition applies to DACA recipients. Q7: Can I renew my period of deferred action and employment authorization under DACA?A7: Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of your DACA. We will consider your request for a renewal on a case-by-case basis under 8 CFR 236.22-23. If we renew our exercise of discretion under DACA for your case, you will receive deferred action for another 2 years, and if you show an economic necessity for employment, you may receive employment authorization for that period.

If you are currently in immigration detention, you may request consideration of DACA from USCIS. However, if we decide to grant you DACA, we will not approve your DACA request until you are released from detention. If you are requesting DACA, you should tell your deportation officer.Q14: If I am about to be removed by ICE and believe that I meet the guidelines for consideration of DACA, what should I do to seek review of my case before removal?A14: If you believe you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines and are about to be removed, you should immediately contact your case officer or the ICE Detention Reporting and Information Line at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Eastern, Monday – Friday) or email ERO.INFO@ice.dhs.gov.Q15: What should I do if I meet the guidelines of this process and have been issued an ICE detainer following an arrest by a state or local law enforcement officer?A15: If you meet the guidelines and have been served a detainer, you should immediately contact the ICE Detention Reporting and Information Line at 1-888-351-4024 (staffed 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Eastern, Monday–Friday); or email ERO.INFO@ice.dhs.govQ16: If I accepted an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process or my case was terminated or dismissed as part of the case-by-case review process, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?A16: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of DACA even if you have accepted an offer of administrative closure or termination under the case-by-case review process.Q17: If I declined an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?A17: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of DACA even if you declined an offer of administrative closure under the case-by-case review process.Q18: If my case was reviewed as part of the case-by-case review process but I was not offered administrative closure, can I be considered for deferred action under this process?A18: Yes. If you can demonstrate that you meet the guidelines, you will be able to request consideration of DACA even if you were not offered administrative closure following review of your case as part of the case-by-case review process.Q19: Can I request renewal of DACA if I am in a nonimmigrant status (for example F-1, E-2, H-4) or have Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or parole at the time I submit my request?A19: No. You can only request renewal of DACA if, at the time you submit your request and at the time we adjudicate your request, you have no immigration status or parole and were not in any lawful status or parole on June 15, 2012. However, a pending petition or application for nonimmigrant status, TPS, or parole does not prevent you from renewing DACA, if you otherwise meet the threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22.Q20. I am a DACA recipient, and I have been granted parole in place. Can I renew my DACA?A20. No. If you are in a valid period of parole, including if you have an approved Form I-131F, Application for Parole in Place for Certain Noncitizen Spouses and Stepchildren of U.S. Citizens, and the grant of parole in place is still valid, we will not renew your DACA. You can only request consideration of DACA if, both when you submit your request and when we adjudicate your request, you have no parole or lawful immigration status. However, a pending request for parole in place does not prevent you from renewing DACA, if you otherwise meet the threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22.Q21: Will the information I share in my request for consideration of DACA be used for immigration enforcement purposes?A21: Under 8 CFR 236.23(e)(1), DHS will not use information about a requestor in a request for DACA to initiate immigration enforcement proceedings against that requestor, unless DHS is initiating immigration enforcement proceedings due to a criminal offense, fraud, a threat to national security, or public safety concerns. Individuals whose cases are deferred under DACA will not be referred to ICE. The information may be shared with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or to investigate or prosecute a criminal offense.Q22: If my case is referred to ICE for immigration enforcement purposes or if I receive a Notice to Appear, will ICE receive information about my family members and guardians for immigration enforcement purposes?A22: Under 8 CFR § 236.23(e)(2), information contained in your DACA request related to your family members or guardians will not be used for immigration enforcement purposes against them. However, we may share this information with national security and law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than removal, including for assistance in the consideration of DACA, to identify or prevent fraudulent claims, for national security purposes, or for the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense.Q23: Will USCIS verify documents or statements I provide to support my request for DACA?A23: We have the authority to verify documents, facts, and statements provided to support requests for DACA. We may contact education institutions, other government agencies, employers, or other entities to verify information.Return to top.C.

For people who are deaf, hard of hearing or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833. We will not review its discretionary determination to deny your request for DACA. However, you can have a Service Request created if you believe that you met all of the DACA guidelines and that your request was denied because we:Denied the request based on abandonment, when you responded to an RFE or Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) within the prescribed time;Mailed the RFE or NOID to the wrong address although you had changed your address, either online at How to Change Your Address or with a customer service representative on the phone and submitted a Form AR-11, Change of Address, before we issued the RFE or NOID.To ensure the address is updated on a pending case as quickly as possible, we recommend that customers change your address online.

Therefore, if you called a customer service representative to change your address, please be sure you also change your address online or with a Form AR-11.Denied the request on the grounds that you did not come to the United States before your 16th birthday, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you did arrive before reaching that age.Denied the request on the grounds that you were under age 15 at the time of filing but not in removal proceedings, while the evidence submitted at the time of filing show that you indeed were in removal proceedings when the request was filed;Denied the request on the grounds that you were 31 or older as of June 15, 2012, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012;Denied the request on the grounds that you had lawful status on June 15, 2012, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you indeed were in an unlawful immigration status on that date;Denied the request on the grounds that you were not physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and up through the date of filing, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you were, in fact, present;Denied on the grounds that you are not currently in school, have not graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have not obtained a GED certificate, and are not an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States;Denied the request due to your failure to appear at a USCIS ASC where we may collect your biometrics, when you in fact either did appear at a USCIS ASC to have this done or requested before the scheduled date of your biometrics appointment to have the appointment rescheduled; orDenied the request because you did not pay the filing fees for Form I-821D or Form I-765 when you actually did pay these fees.Q28: If USCIS does not exercise deferred action in my case, will I be placed in removal proceedings?A28: If we deny your request for DACA under 8 CFR 236.23, we will not issue a Notice to Appear or refer your case to ICE for possible enforcement action based on our denial, unless we determine that your case involves denial for a criminal offense, fraud, a threat to national security, or public safety concerns. We may consider factors including, but not limited to, whether a misrepresentation is willful, material, and knowing in determining whether fraud is involved in a case.Q29: Can USCIS terminate my DACA before it expires?A29: Yes. DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and under 8 CFR 236.23(d), we may terminate a grant of DACA at any time, at USCIS’ discretion. We will provide a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) and an opportunity to respond before terminating a DACA grant, except we may terminate a grant of DACA without an NOIT and an opportunity to respond if you are convicted of a national security-related offense involving conduct described in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), (iv), or 1227(a)(4)(A)(i)), or an egregious public safety offense. If we terminate your grant of DACA without an NOIT and an opportunity to respond, we will notify you of the termination.Q30: What happens to my employment authorization if USCIS terminates my DACA before it expires?A30: A grant of employment authorization based on DACA, under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33), will automatically terminate when DACA terminates. See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(3).Return to top.II. Initial Requests for DACAQ31: What guidelines must I meet to be considered for DACA?A31: Under current court orders, we are accepting, but not adjudicating, initial requests for DACA. Under 8 CFR 236.22, to be considered for DACA you must submit evidence, including supporting documents, showing that you:Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981);Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up until you filed your request for DACA;Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and when you filed your request for DACA with USCIS;Had no lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012,* and when you filed your request for DACA, meaning that:You never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012, orAny lawful immigration status or parole that you had before June 15, 2012, expired as of June 15, 2012, andAny lawful status that you had after June 15, 2012, expired or otherwise ended before you submitted your request for DACA;Are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.We consider on a case-by-case basis deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Even if you meet the threshold criteria listed above and at 8 CFR 236.22(b), we retain the discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that any specific factor makes deferred action inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22(c).* Please review Q19 if you are currently in a lawful immigration status.Q32: I first came to the United States before I turned 16 years old, and I have been continuously residing in the United States since at least June 15, 2007. Before I turned 16 years old, however, I left the United States for some period before returning and beginning my current period of continuous residence. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A32: Yes, but only if you established residence in the United States during the period before you turned 16 years old, as evidenced, for example, by records showing you attended school or worked in the United States during that time, or that you lived in the United States for multiple years during that time. In addition to establishing that you initially resided in the United States before you turned 16 years old, you must also have maintained continuous residence in the United States from June 15, 2007, until the present time to be considered for deferred action under this process. See 8 CFR 236.22(b)(1)-(2).Q33: To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence documenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period?A33: To meet the continuous residence guideline under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(2), you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the United States from June 15, 2007, up until the time of filing your request. You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence.It is helpful for us if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the United States for the period since June 15, 2007. Gaps in the documentation for certain periods may raise doubts about your continued residence if they are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been outside the United States for a period that was not brief, casual or innocent.If gaps in your documentation raise questions, we may issue a Request for Evidence(RFE) to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous residence.You may submit affidavits to explain a gap in the documentation showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement. If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances during the period when there is a gap in the documentation. You may only use affidavits to explain gaps in your continuous residence; you cannot use them as evidence that you meet the entire 5-year continuous residence requirement.Q34: I came to the United States when I was very young and before I began attending school, so I do not have primary evidence of the start of my continuous residence in the United States. Can I submit an affidavit as proof of the start of my continuous residence period?A34: DHS will accept affidavits for the start of the continuous residence period if you are a new initial requestor who arrived in the United States at or before age 8. We recognize that age 8 is the highest age at which school attendance becomes required within the United States, and that it may be more challenging for individuals who arrived before that age to provide primary evidence of the start of their continuous residence period.Q35: Does “currently enrolled in school” refer to the date when I file the request for consideration of deferred action?A35: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in school on the date you submit a DACA request.Q36: Who is considered to be “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A36: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in:A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements;An education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; orAn education program helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) in the United States.Education, literacy, and career training programs (including vocational training), or education programs helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law, or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam in the United States, may include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations. Programs funded by other sources may qualify if they have demonstrated effectiveness.In assessing whether programs are of demonstrated effectiveness, we will consider:The duration of the program’s existence;The program’s track record in:Assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent;Passing a GED or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC); orPlacing students in postsecondary education, job training, or employment; andOther indicators of the program’s overall quality.If you seek to demonstrate that you are “currently enrolled in school” with your enrollment in such a program, you must show the program’s demonstrated effectiveness.Q37: How do I establish that I am currently enrolled in school?A37: Documentation showing that you are enrolled in school may include evidence that you are enrolled in:A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school or secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements; orAn education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that:Has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English, or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; andIs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness; orAn education program assisting students in obtaining a high school equivalency diploma or certificate recognized under state law (such as by passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), and that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness.Evidence of enrollment may include acceptance letters, school registration cards, letters from a school or program, transcripts, report cards, or progress reports that may show the name of the school or program, date of enrollment, and current educational or grade level, if relevant. See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents.Q38: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school?A38: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation showing that you have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to:A high school diploma from a public or private high school or secondary school; orA certificate of completion, a certificate of attendance, or an alternate award from a public or private high school or secondary school or a recognized equivalent of a high school diploma under state law, or a GED certificate or certificate from passing another such state authorized exam (e.g., HiSet or TASC) in the United States.Q39: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC)?A39: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation demonstrating that you have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to, evidence that you have passed a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) and received the recognized equivalent of a regular high school diploma under state law.Q40: If I am enrolled in a literacy or career training program, can I meet the guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A40: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) if you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. Such programs include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or if funded by other sources, are programs of demonstrated effectiveness.Q41: If I am enrolled in an English as a second language (ESL) program, can I meet the guidelines?A41: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) through enrollment in an ESL program if the ESL program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or is a program of demonstrated effectiveness. You must submit direct documentary evidence that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants, administered by a nonprofit organization, or of demonstrated effectiveness.Q42: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A42: No. We will not accept evidence that is not listed in Chart #1 to establish that you are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a GED or passed another state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5). You must submit any of the documentary evidence listed in Chart #1 to show that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5).Q43: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met certain threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?A43: You may use evidence other than those documents listed in Chart #1 to establish that you meet the following guidelines and factual showings, if available documentary evidence is insufficient or lacking and shows that:You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You satisfy the continuous residence requirement, if you present direct evidence of your continued residence in the United States for a portion of the required period and the circumstantial evidence is used only to fill in gaps in the length of continuous residence demonstrated by the direct evidence; andAny travel outside the United States during the period of required continuous presence was brief, casual, and innocent.However, we will not accept evidence other than the documents listed in Chart #1 as proof that you meet any of the following guidelines:You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYou are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States.For example, even if you do not have documentary proof of your presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, you may still be able to demonstrate that you meet the guideline. You may do so by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in the United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which may be enough to infer you were present June 15, 2012, as well. However, we will not accept evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit the designated documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet this guideline.Chart #1 provides examples of documentation you may submit to demonstrate you meet the threshold criteria for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Please see the instructions for Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, for additional details of acceptable documentation.Chart #1 Examples of Documents to Submit to Demonstrate You Meet the GuidelinesProof of identityPassport or national identity document from your country of originBirth certificate with photo identificationSchool or military ID with photoAny U.S. government immigration or other document bearing your name and photoProof you came to U.S. before your 16th birthdayPassport with admission stampForm I-94, Form I-95, or Form I-94WSchool records from the U.S. schools you have attendedAny Immigration and Naturalization Service or DHS document stating your date of entry (Form I-862, Notice to Appear)Travel recordsHospital or medical recordsRent receipts or utility billsEmployment records (pay stubs, W-2 Forms, etc.)Official records from a religious entity confirming participation in a religious ceremonyCopies of money order receipts for money sent in or out of the United StatesBirth certificates of children born in the United StatesDated bank transactionsAutomobile license receipts or registrationDeeds, mortgages, rental agreement contractsTax receipts, insurance policiesProof of lack of lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012, and at the time of filing your DACA request (8 CFR 236.22(b)(4))Form I-94/I-95/I-94W with authorized stay expiration dateFinal order of exclusion, deportation, or removal issued as of June 15, 2012A charging document placing you into removal proceedingsProof of physical presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of filing your DACA request (8 CFR 236.22(b)(3))Rent receipts or utility billsEmployment records (pay stubs, W-2 Forms, etc.)School records (letters, report cards, etc.)Military records (Form DD-214 or NGB Form 22)Official records from a religious entity confirming participation in a religious ceremonyCopies of money order receipts for money sent in or out of the United StatesPassport entriesBirth certificates of children born in the United StatesDated bank transactionsAutomobile license receipts or registrationDeeds, mortgages, rental agreement contractsTax receipts, insurance policiesAffidavits for the start of the continuous presence period if you arrived in the United States before age 8Proof you continuously resided in the United States from June 15, 2007, to the time of filing your DACA request (8 CFR 236.22(b)(2))Proof of your education status at the time of requesting consideration of DACA (8 CFR 236.22(b)(5))School records (transcripts, report cards, etc.) from the school that you are currently attending in the United States showing the name(s) of the school(s) and periods of school attendance and the current educational or grade levelU.S. high school diploma, certificate of completion, or other alternate awardHigh school equivalency diploma or certificate recognized under state lawEvidence that you passed a state-authorized exam, including the GED or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) in the United StatesProof you are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. armed forces or the U.S. Coast Guard (8 CFR 236.22(b)(5))Form DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active DutyNGB Form 22, National Guard Report of Separation and Record of ServiceMilitary personnel recordsMilitary health recordsQ44: May I file affidavits as proof that I meet the threshold criteria for consideration of DACA at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?A44: Affidavits generally will not be sufficient on their own to demonstrate that you meet the threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b) for us to consider you for DACA. However, you may use affidavits to support meeting the following guidelines if the documentary evidence available to you is insufficient or lacking:Showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement;Establishing the start of the continuous residence period if you entered the United States before age 8; andEstablishing that departures during the required period of continuous residence were brief, casual, and innocent.If you submit affidavits related to the above criteria, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself, who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances. If we determine that the affidavits are insufficient to overcome the unavailability or lack of documentary evidence with respect to either of these guidelines, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating you must submit further evidence to demonstrate that you meet these guidelines.We will not accept affidavits to satisfy the following guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b):You are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion or other alternate award from high school, have obtained a high school equivalency diploma or certificate (such as by passing the GED exam or other similar state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), or are an honorably discharged veteran from the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States;You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYour lack of disqualifying criminal history.If the only evidence you submit to demonstrate you meet any of the above guidelines is an affidavit, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating that you have not demonstrated that you meet these guidelines and that you must submit evidence to demonstrate that you meet that guideline.Q45: Can I be considered for deferred action under this process if I had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal pending before either USCIS or the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on June 15, 2012?A45: Yes. If you had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal, or similar relief, pending before either USCIS or EOIR as of June 15, 2012, but had no lawful status, you may request consideration of DACA.Q46: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I violated my immigration status (for example, by engaging in unauthorized employment, failing to report to my employer, or failing to pursue a full course of study) before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A46: No, unless the Executive Office for Immigration Review terminated your status by issuing a final order of removal against you before June 15, 2012.Q47: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I \"aged out\" of my dependent nonimmigrant status as of June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A47: Yes. For purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,\" guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if you were admitted for duration of status or for a period of time that extended past June 14, 2012, but aged out of your dependent nonimmigrant status on or before June 15, 2012, (meaning you turned 21 years old on or before June 15, 2012), you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q48: I was admitted for duration of status, but my status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is listed as terminated on or before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A48: Yes. For the purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,” guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if your status as of June 15, 2012, is listed as “terminated” in SEVIS, you may be considered for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q49: I am a Canadian citizen who was inspected by CBP but was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A49: In general, a Canadian citizen who was admitted as a visitor for business or pleasure and not issued a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record (also known as a “non-controlled” Canadian nonimmigrant) is lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. For that reason, unless there is evidence, including verifiable evidence provided by the individual, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time, DHS will consider, for purposes of 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 only, that the alien was lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. If DHS can verify from its records that your last noncontrolled entry occurred on or before Dec. 14, 2011, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q50: I used my Border Crossing Card (BCC) to obtain admission to the United States and was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A50: Because the limitations on entry for a BCC holder vary based on location of admission and travel, DHS will assume that the BCC holder who was not provided a Form I-94 was admitted for the longest period legally possible—30 days—unless the individual can demonstrate, through verifiable evidence, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time. Accordingly, if DHS is able to verify from its records that your last admission was using a BCC, you were not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission, and it occurred on or before May 14, 2012, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q51: Do I accrue unlawful presence if I have a pending initial request for consideration of DACA?A51: You will continue to accrue unlawful presence while the request for consideration of DACA is pending unless you are under 18 years of age at the time of the request. If you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your request, you will not accrue unlawful presence while the request is pending, even if you turn 18 while your request is pending with USCIS. If we grant your DACA request, you will not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action. However, having deferred action will not excuse previously accrued unlawful presence.Return to top.III. Renewal of DACAQ52: When should I file my DACA renewal request?A52: We strongly encourage you to submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice and EAD. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision.DACA recipients may submit a DACA renewal request online. To file Form I-821D and Form I-765 online, a DACA requestor must first create a USCIS online account, which provides a convenient and secure method to submit forms, pay fees and track the status of any pending USCIS immigration request throughout the adjudication process. There is no cost to set up an account, which offers a variety of features, including the ability to communicate with USCIS through a secure inbox and respond online to Requests for Evidence. For additional information on filing a DACA renewal request online, go to the Form I-821D webpage. All online DACA renewal requests must include Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS and accompanying fees.USCIS’ current goal is to process DACA renewal requests within 120 days. You may submit an inquiry online about the status of your renewal request after it has been pending more than 105 days. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to:If you fail to appear at an ASC for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. It will take longer to process your request if you miss or reschedule your appointments;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orA renewal submission that is incomplete or contains evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines and we must request additional evidence or an explanation.Q53: Can I file a renewal request outside the recommended filing period of 120 to 150 days before my current DACA expires?A53: We strongly encourages you to file your renewal request within the recommended 120- to 150-day filing period to minimize the possibility that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. We will accept requests we receive earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expires; however, this could result in an overlap between your current DACA and your renewal. This means your renewal period may extend for less than a full 2 years from the date that your current DACA period expires.If you file less than 120 days before your current period of DACA expires, there is more risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. If you file after your most recent DACA period expires, but within 1 year of its expiration, you may submit a request to renew your DACA. If you are filing beyond 1 year after your most recent period of DACA expired, or if your most recent grant of DACA was terminated at any time, you may still request DACA by submitting a new initial request.Please note: An ongoing July 16, 2021, injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and, on Oct. 14, 2022, was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect and prohibits DHS from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule. Due to the partial stay of the injunction, DHS presently may grant DACA renewal requests under the final rule.Q54: How will USCIS evaluate my request for renewal of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A54: We may consider renewing your DACA if you met the guidelines for consideration of Initial DACA (see above and 8 CFR 236.22(b)) and you:Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012;Have continuously resided in the United States since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved up to the present time; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.These guidelines must be met for consideration of DACA renewal. We consider deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 on a case-by-case basis. Even if you meet the guidelines, we have discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that deferred action is inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22I.Q55. Do I accrue unlawful presence if I am seeking renewal and my previous period of DACA expires before I receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA? Similarly, what would happen to my work authorization?A55: Yes, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will accrue unlawful presence for any time between the periods of deferred action, unless you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your renewal request.Similarly, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will not be authorized to work in the United States regardless of your age at time of filing until and unless you receive a new EAD from USCIS.Q56. Do I need to provide additional documents when I request renewal of deferred action under DACA?A56. No, unless you have new documents pertaining to removal proceedings or criminal history that you have not already submitted to USCIS in a previously approved DACA request. However, we reserve the authority, at our discretion, to request additional documents, information or statements relating to a DACA renewal request determination.CAUTION: If you knowingly and willfully provide materially false information on Form I-821D, you will be committing a federal felony punishable by a fine, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. In addition, you may be placed into removal proceedings, face severe penalties provided by law, and be subject to criminal prosecution.Q57.; If I am no longer enrolled in school, can I still request to renew my DACA?A57. Yes. Neither Form I-821D nor the instructions ask renewal requestors for information about continued school enrollment or graduation. The instructions for renewal requests specify that you may be considered for DACA renewal if you met the guidelines for consideration of initial DACA, including the educational guidelines and:Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without advance parole;Have continuously resided in the United States, up to the present time, since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)or 3 or more other misdemeanors and are not a threat to national security or public safety.Q58. If I initially received DACA and was under age 31 on June 15, 2012, but have since become 31 or older, can I still request renewal of DACA?A58. Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of DACA as long as you were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012. IV. TravelQ59: May I travel outside the United States before I submit an initial DACA request or while my initial DACA request is pending with USCIS?A59: Any unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt your continuous residence, and you will not be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. We will assess any travel outside of the United States that occurred on or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012, to determine whether the travel qualifies as brief, casual and innocent. (See Chart #2.)CAUTION: You should be aware that if you have been ordered deported or removed, and you then leave the United States, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.Q60: As a DACA recipient, can I travel outside of the United States?A60: Not automatically. If you want to travel outside the United States after receiving DACA, you must apply for an advance parole document by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and paying the applicable fee. We will determine whether your purpose for international travel is justifiable based on the circumstances you describe in your request. Generally, we will only issue an advance parole document if you want to travel outside the United States for:Humanitarian purposes, including to obtain medical treatment, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit an ailing relative;Educational purposes, such as semester abroad programs and academic research; orEmployment purposes, including but not limited to overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or training, consular appointment for an employer-sponsored nonimmigrant visa, or meetings with clients overseas.Travel for vacation is not a valid basis for advance parole.Travel for educational purposes means travel affiliated with an institution that provides education as its primary purpose. You do not have to be enrolled in the institution that the program is affiliated with, but you must be enrolled in the program you will be traveling with.You may not apply for an advance parole document unless and until we approve your DACA request. If you are submitting a DACA renewal request, you may apply for advance parole at the same time; however, there is a separate filing address for advance parole requests, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will consider all advance parole requests on a case-by-case basis.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131.If we have granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 after you have been ordered deported or removed, you may still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above.CAUTION: If you have been ordered deported or removed, before you leave the United States, you should seek to reopen your case before the EOIR and obtain administrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding. Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you should not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or removed, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, you may be considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. If you have any questions about this process, you may contact ICE through the local ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor with jurisdiction over your case.Q61: What happens to my DACA grant if I leave the United States without advance parole?A61: CAUTION: When you leave the United States, you are no longer in a period of deferred action. DACA recipients who leave the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States. We strongly encourage you to obtain an advance parole document before you leave to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA.We may terminate a grant of DACA, in our discretion and after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond, for DACA recipients who depart from the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document and subsequently enter the United States without inspection. See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(2). Generally, a recent entry without inspection will be a significant negative factor warranting termination of DACA as a threat to border security, but where there are exigent circumstances, such as accidental or involuntary border crossings, DHS may choose to continue exercising prosecutorial discretion and allow the grant of deferred action to continue.DACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining advance parole but who are paroled into the United States may resume their DACA upon expiration of the period of parole.Q62: Why does my advance parole document show a 1-day parole period?A62: Your advance parole document may show a parole period of 1 day because it is to facilitate your reentry into the United States, at which time you will resume your current DACA validity period. This is different from the language on your advance parole document that authorizes a departure and reentry between specified dates. Please review your advance parole document carefully to understand the details of your travel authorization.Q63: Do brief departures from the United States interrupt the continuous residence requirement?A63: A brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt continuous residence, regardless of whether it was otherwise brief, casual, and innocent. Your absence from the United States will be considered brief, casual, and innocent if it was on or after June 15, 2007, and before Aug. 15, 2012, and:The absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure before you were placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings; andThe purpose of the absence and your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law.Once we have approved your request for DACA, you may file Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States.CAUTION: If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without authorization and subsequently enter without inspection, DHS will issue you a Notice of Intent to Terminate and may, barring exigent circumstances, terminate your deferred action under DACA in its discretion,Travel Guidelines (Chart #2)Travel DatesType of TravelDoes It Affect Continuous ResidenceOn or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012Brief, casual and innocentNoFor an extended timeBecause of an order of exclusion, deportation, voluntary departure, or removalTo participate in criminal activityYesOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACAAnyYes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case, and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.In addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACAAnyOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after receiving DACAAnyIt depends. If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, if you travel without authorization, the travel will interrupt your continuous residence.Q64: May I file a request for advance parole at the same time I file my DACA package?A64: You may file an advance parole request at the same time as a DACA renewal request (but not at the same time as an initial DACA request). However, the filing addresses for a DACA renewal request and an advance parole request are different, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will not issue an advance parole document for a period that continues past your DACA validity period.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131.To request advance parole, you must submit Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. Please visit the Form I-131 webpage before you begin the process to make sure you are using the current version of the form. To request advance parole to travel outside the United States, you must complete and sign Form I-131 and include the required filing fee, as listed on the Form I-131 webpage.You can find information on where to file on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-131 webpage under “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).” If you do not send Form I-131 to the correct address, it may significantly delay adjudication of your application or cause us to deny it.Q65: Will USCIS expedite the processing of a DACA Form I-131 advance parole application currently pending with USCIS?A65: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within the sole discretion of USCIS. Please visit the USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitions for more information and guidance on expedite requests.Q66: What if I am experiencing an extremely urgent situation and have not filed my Form I-131 advance parole application?A66:If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation and need to travel within 90 days, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office by contacting the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment:A completed and signed Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (such as medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); and2 passport-style photos.Return to top.V. Criminal ConvictionsQ67: If I have a conviction for a felony offense, a misdemeanor offense described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or multiple other misdemeanors, can I be granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A67: No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, a misdemeanor offense described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct, we will not consider you for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q68: What offenses qualify as a felony?A68: A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year.A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.Q69: What offenses constitute disqualifying misdemeanors (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) for purposes of DACA?A69: For purposes of DACA, a misdemeanor (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) that meets the following criteria:Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; orIf not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence.The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE.A single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described above is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.Notwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of any misdemeanor convictions as described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion.Q70: What offenses constitute “other misdemeanors” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))?A70: For purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), an “other misdemeanor” is any misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater 5 days) that meets the following criteria:Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; andIs an offense for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE.Three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA.The decision to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors”  is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion.A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.Q71: If I have a minor traffic offense, such as driving without a license, will it be considered a misdemeanor that counts towards the “3 or more other misdemeanors” and make me unable to receive consideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A71: We will not consider a minor traffic offense a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), and it is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we can consider your entire offense history along with other facts to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, you warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.It is important to emphasize that driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), regardless of the sentence imposed.Q72: What qualifies as a national security or public safety threat?A72: If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request for deferred action indicates that your presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security, we will not grant your DACA request. Indicators that you pose such a threat include, but are not limited to, gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States.Q73: Will offenses criminalized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws be considered disqualifying convictions for purpose of DACA?A73: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), convictions under state laws (including U.S. territories) for immigration-related offenses are not considered convictions for purposes of DACA.Q74: Will USCIS consider my expunged conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication as a disqualifying conviction for purposes of DACA?A74: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), we do not consider expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications disqualifying convictions for purposes of DACA. However, we will assess expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, under the circumstances, you present a national security or public safety concern and a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is otherwise warranted. If you were a juvenile, but tried and convicted as an adult, we will not consider your conviction a juvenile delinquency adjudication.Return to top.VI. Employment AuthorizationQ75. What should I do if my EAD was lost, stolen, or damaged?A75. If your deferred action under DACA is currently valid, and you do not need to renew it, but you need to replace a valid EAD because yours was lost, stolen, or damaged, file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and select box 1.b. Submit the properly completed Form I-765, evidence that you are a current DACA recipient (such as your most recent DACA approval notice), and filing fee to the filing address for the location where you live.Do not file Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, with this Form I-765. If you submit Form I-821D when you are filing to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged EAD, we will deny your Form I-821D and we will not refund the $85 filing fee for Form I-821D.Return to top.VII. MiscellaneousQ76: Can USCIS terminate my DACA grant?A76: DHS may seek to terminate a grant of DACA at any time in its discretion. However, in most cases we will provide DACA recipients with a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT), with an opportunity to respond, before termination. We have discretion to terminate without providing a DACA recipient a NOIT and opportunity to respond if you were convicted of a national security-related offense involving conduct described in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv), or 1227(a)(4)(A)(i), or an egregious public safety offense.Q77: Does deferred action provide a path to permanent resident status (a Green Card) or citizenship?A77: No. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion that does not confer lawful permanent resident status or a path to citizenship. Only Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.Q78: Can I be considered for deferred action even if I do not meet the guidelines to be considered for DACA?A78: The process at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is only for individuals who meet the specific guidelines for DACA. Other individuals may, on a case-by-case basis, request deferred action from USCIS or ICE in certain circumstances, consistent with longstanding practice.Q79: How will ICE and USCIS handle cases involving individuals who do not satisfy the guidelines of this process but believe they may otherwise warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion?A79: If we find that you do not satisfy the DACA guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b) or otherwise determines you do not warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, then we will decline to defer action in your case. If you are currently in removal proceedings, have a final order, or have a voluntary departure order, you may then request ICE consider whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Guidance on requests to ICE for prosecutorial discretion is available at ICE’s Prosecutorial Discretion webpage.Q80: How should I fill out question 9 on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization?A80. When you are filing a Form I-765 as part of a DACA request, question 9 is asking you to list those Social Security numbers that were officially issued to you by the Social Security Administration.Q81: Is there supervisory review of decisions by USCIS under this process?A81: Yes. We have implemented a successful supervisory review process to ensure a consistent process for considering requests for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q82: Do USCIS personnel responsible for reviewing requests for DACA receive special training?A82: Yes. USCIS personnel responsible for considering requests for consideration of DACA have received special training.Q83: Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at group assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS?A83: Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 292.3 and 1003.102, practitioners are required to file Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, when they engage in practice in immigration matters before DHS, either in person or through the preparation or filing of any brief, application, petition, or other document. Under these rules, a practitioner who consistently violates the requirement to file a Form G-28 may be subject to disciplinary sanctions; however, on Feb. 28, 2011, we issued a statement indicating that we do not intend to initiate disciplinary proceedings against practitioners (attorneys and accredited representatives) based solely on the failure to submit a Form G-28 in relation to pro bono services provided at group assistance events. DHS is in the process of issuing a final rule, at which time this matter will be reevaluated.Q84: When must an individual sign a Form I-821D as a preparer?A84: Anytime someone other than the requestor prepares or helps fill out the Form I-821D, that individual must complete Part 5 of the form.Q85: If I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for consideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company?A85: You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting DACA with documentation which verifies their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment) unless there is evidence of egregious violations of criminal statutes or widespread abuses.Q86: Can I request consideration for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 if I live in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)?A86: Yes, in certain circumstances. The CNMI is part of the United States for immigration purposes and is not excluded from this process. However, because of the specific guidelines for consideration of DACA, individuals who have been residents of the CNMI are in most cases unlikely to meet the criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b). You must, among other things, have come to the United States before your 16th birthday and have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007.Under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, the CNMI became part of the United States for purposes of immigration law only on Nov. 28, 2009. Therefore, entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or residence in, the United States for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b).We have used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address humanitarian needs on a case-by-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action under this process, except that your entry or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before Nov. 28, 2009, we are willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole. If this situation applies to you, you should make an appointment  in Saipan to discuss your case with an immigration officer.Q87: Will USCIS expedite the processing of my pending DACA request?A87: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within our sole discretion. Please visit the USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitions for more information and guidance on expedite requests.Evidence showing the humanitarian need for expediting your DACA request may include, but is not limited to, evidence of loss of employment, disenrollment from an educational program, or medical or health-related emergencies.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal requests between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires to minimize the risk of your DACA lapsing.Q88: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my DACA request. Is this true?A88: No. While practitioners may charge a fee for preparation of your DACA request, including a request to expedite, an attorney or accredited representative who guarantees faster processing by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you and take your money. Visit our Avoid Scams page to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams.Although you may request that USCIS expedite processing of your DACA request, there is no fee to request expedited processing. Make sure you seek information about requests for consideration of DACA from official government sources such as USCIS or DHS. If you are seeking legal advice, visit our Find Legal Services page to learn how to choose a licensed attorney or accredited representative.Q89: Am I required to register with the Selective Service?A89:  Most male persons residing in the United States, who are ages 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service. Visit the Selective Service System website for more information.Q90: How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a DACA recipient?A90: An employer may be engaging in discrimination if they:Demand that an employee show specific documents or ask for more or different documents than are required to complete Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, or create an E-Verify case; orReject documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents that reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, including documentation showing work authorization because it has a future expiration date or because of an employee’s prior unauthorized status.The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not discriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the United States. These include DACA recipients who have been granted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-237-2515).For more information about unfair employment practices against DACA recipients, please read IER’s factsheet in English  (PDF) or Spanish  (PDF).For additional resources and information about workers’ rights, visit the Department of Justice Reminders for DACA Recipients and Employers webpage.Return to top.",

      "last_updated": "information.Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me?A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry.Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA?A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry.Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do?A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process.Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do?A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole.

What should I do if my current or new employee is a DACA recipient?A27. The Sept. 13, 2023 decision from the U.S. District Court from the Southern District of Texas expanded its July 16, 2021 injunction and vacatur order to the DACA Final Rule, but maintained the partial stay for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021,” so the recent court order does not disturb the grant of deferred action or the validity of work authorization for current DACA recipients. USCIS will also continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewal and associated applications for employment authorization. USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders.No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issued guidance for DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization.New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. See I-9 Central for more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present.The court decision is not a basis to ask any employee to show more or different documentation to verify or reverify their employment authorization on Form I-9.If you participate in E-Verify, the system can confirm identity and employment eligibility for new employees who are DACA recipients with a valid and unexpired EAD.For information about the rights of employees, please see the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Immigrant and Employee Rights Section's information on employee rights.Previous Litigation Updates:Oct. 14, 2022On Oct. 5, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision  (PDF) on the 2012 Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) policy in Texas et al. v. United States of America et al., No. 21-40680 (5th Cir. 2022). The court partially affirmed the district court’s July 2021 decision declaring the 2012 DACA policy unlawful. However, the court of appeals preserved the partial stay issued by the district court in July 2021 and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings regarding the new DHS DACA regulation published on Aug. 30, 2022 and scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 31, 2022. On Oct. 14, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued an order extending its injunction and partial stay to the DACA Final Rule.At this time, this ruling does not affect current grants of DACA for existing DACA recipients and related Employment Authorization Documents. While the DACA final rule is considered by the court, consistent with the court orders and the ongoing partial stay, we continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests, accompanying requests for employment authorization, and applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients, and will continue to accept but not process initial DACA requests. Current valid grants of DACA, related employment authorization, and advance parole will continue to be recognized as valid under the final rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related employment authorization do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.Beginning on Oct. 31, DHS will continue to grant or deny DACA renewal requests and related requests for employment authorization, in accordance with 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, pursuant to the DACA regulation. Pending requests will be adjudicated under the Final Rule beginning on Oct. 31 and do not need to be re-filed. However, under the court orders DHS remains prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and accompanying requests for employment authorization.The FAQs below provide additional information.We will provide additional updates as more information is available.July 16, 2021On July 16, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas held in State of Texas, et al., v. United States of America, et al., 1:18-CV-00068, (S.D. Texas July 16, 2021) that the DACA policy reflected in the June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum “is illegal.” The court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims; vacated the 2012 DACA memorandum; remanded the memorandum to DHS for further consideration; and issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the government’s continued administration of DACA and the reimplementation of DACA without compliance with the APA. However, the court temporarily stayed part of its order vacating the DACA memorandum and its injunction with regard to individuals who obtained DACA on or before July 16, 2021, including those with renewal requests.Dec. 4, 2020Consistent with this July 16, 2021, court order and with the stay, DHS continues to accept the filing of both initial and DACA renewal requests, as well as accompanying requests for employment authorization. In compliance with an order of a U.S. district court, and effective Dec. 7, 2020, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is:Accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA based on the terms of the DACA policy in effect before Sept. 5, 2017 and in accordance with the court’s Dec. 4, 2020 order;Accepting DACA renewal requests based on the terms of the DACA policy in effect before Sept. 5, 2017 and in accordance with the court’s Dec. 4, 2020 order;Accepting applications for advance parole documents based on the terms of the DACA policy before Sept. 5, 2017 and in accordance with the court’s Dec. 4, 2020 order;Extending one-year grants of deferred action under DACA to 2 years; andExtending one-year EADs under DACA to 2 years.USCIS has taken appropriate steps to provide evidence of the 1-year extensions of deferred action and EADs under DACA to individuals who were issued documentation on or after July 28, 2020 with a one-year validity period under the defunct policy.DHS will comply with the order while it is in effect.",

          "question": "Q1. What is the latest information regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?",
          "answer": "A1. On Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Final Rule unlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021 injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” Accordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated. In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. We will also continue to accept but not process initial DACA requests. See theMemorandum and OrderandSupplemental Order of Injunction. Current valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal. Q2. What did the court orders say? What do they mean? A2. The Sept. 13, 2023, order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas found the DACA Final Rule unlawful, but maintained a partial stay of its order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” The partial stay allows DHS to continue to accept initial as well as DACA renewal requests, but permits DHS to approve only renewal requests and prohibits DHS from approving initial DACA requests. Therefore, consistent with this order, USCIS is continuing to accept the filing of both initial and DACA renewal requests, as well as accompanying applications for employment authorization, but will not grant initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021 and their accompanying requests for employment authorization. USCIS will grant or deny DACA renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. Current valid grants of DACA, related employment authorization and advance parole will continue to be recognized as valid. DHS will comply with the court order while it is in effect. Q3. Is the DACA policy over? A3. No. While the court order does not allow USCIS to approve initial DACA requests, we are presently able to continue processing DACA renewals and associated applications because the court maintained a partial stay of its injunction for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.”. While USCIS will continue accepting initial DACA requests, the ongoing injunction and partial stay continue to prohibit DHS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021 and their accompanying requests for employment authorization. USCIS will continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewals and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and advance parole. Q4. What does this recent court decision mean if I am: A4. A current DACA recipient:If you currently have DACA and your work authorization has not expired, your DACA is still in effect, and you are eligible to request renewal at the appropriate time pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court decision does not affect the validity period of current grants of DACA, related work authorization, or advance parole.A DACA renewal requestor:Individuals requesting DACA as a renewal may continue to submit DACA renewal requests. USCIS will continue to process and issue a decision on your DACA renewal request, pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23.An initial DACA requestor:While USCIS will accept your initial DACA request, we are prohibited from granting initial requests or an accompanying application for employment authorization while the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas is in effect. If you have an initial DACA request pending, your request is on hold while the court orders are in effect. For more information about submitting initial DACA requests or DACA renewal requests, see additional questions and answers below. Q5. What is considered an “initial” DACA request? A5. An initial request for DACA includes: A first-time request for DACA;A request filed by an individual who was previously granted DACA but did not request renewal within one year of the expiration; orA request filed by an individual whose most recent DACA grant was terminated. Q6. What is considered a DACA “renewal” request? A6. A DACA renewal request includes: A request filed by an individual with a current DACA grant; orA request filed by an individual within one year of the expiration of their prior DACA grant. Q7. What does this mean if I have an initial DACA request currently pending with USCIS? A7. USCIS is not allowed to approve initial DACA requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization while the order from U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas is in effect. If you have an initial DACA request pending with USCIS, your request will remain on hold to comply with the court orders. At this time, USCIS is holding cases, rather than rejecting or closing them. While USCIS holds these cases, they will remain pending, though under the Sept. 13, 2023 court order, USCIS is not able to grant the requests that are on hold. Because these cases will remain on hold while the court order is in effect, USCIS will not issue refunds for initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court order is in effect. USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the litigation continues. Q8. How does the Sept. 13, 2023, district court decision affect the processing times for DACA requests? A8. At this time, USCIS cannot predict the effect the order may have on processing times for initial DACA requests, as DHS is prohibited from approving initial requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization under the court order. However, we maintain our goal of processing DACA renewal requests generally within 120 days and are committed to minimizing any processing delays for renewal requests. If your DACA renewal request has been pending more than 105 days, you maysubmit an inquiry onlineabout the status of your renewal request. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to: Failure to appear at an Application Support Center for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. If you do not appear or you reschedule your appointment, it will increase the processing time for your request;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orAn incomplete renewal submission or a submission with evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines, and USCIS must send a request for additional evidence or explanation. Q9. I have another type of immigration benefit application or petition pending in addition to my DACA request. Do the court orders affect my other benefit application or petition? A9. No. While the court orders prohibit USCIS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021, and their accompanying requests for employment authorization, they do not affect applications, petitions, or requests for other immigration benefits. Initials Q10. If I submit an initial DACA request on or after July 16, 2021, what will happen to my DACA request? A10. USCIS is continuing to accept initial DACA requests. If you file an initial DACA request with USCIS on or after July 16, 2021, you will receive a receipt notice, and USCIS will process your payment. However, USCIS will not adjudicate your request while the court orders are in effect. Q11. If I received a receipt notice for my initial DACA request, does that mean I was granted DACA? A11. No. A receipt notice demonstrates that USCIS has received your initial DACA request. It does not indicate that we have approved your request. Q12. Will USCIS issue me a refund if I have filed an initial DACA request? A12. At this time, USCIS is not issuing refunds for pending initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court orders are in effect. USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the Southern District of Texas litigation continues. Q13. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) for my initial DACA request and that RFE or NOID is still pending. What should I do? A13. Although USCIS is prohibited from granting your initial request due to the court order, you may respond to the RFE or NOID within the requested time frame. Ensuring your filing is complete will help USCIS to make a timely decision in your case if USCIS is allowed to resume adjudication of initial DACA requests in the future. Renewals Q14. I currently have DACA, and it is about to expire. Can I file for a renewal? A14. Yes. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court orders have not affected or changed the filing process for DACA renewals. If there is a change to the effectiveness or scope of the court orders, USCIS will publish revised information. Q15. Should I renew early? A15. USCIS strongly encourages DACA recipients to file their renewal requests 120 to 150 days (4 to 5 months) before their current DACA validity period expires. Q16. Is there a chance USCIS will stop accepting DACA renewals in the future? A16. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. At this time, due to the partial stay of the Sept. 13, 2023 order, the court order has not affected the filing process for DACA renewals. Future court orders may affect USCIS’s ability to accept and approve DACA renewal requests. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. Q17. I had DACA and it expired within the last 12 months. Am I eligible to renew? A17. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its expiration, a new request is considered a renewal request, not an initial request under preexisting policy, and you may submit a request to renew your DACA. The court orders have not disturbed the filing process for DACA renewals. Q18. If it has been more than one year since my last grant of DACA expired, can I still apply for renewal? A18. If you submit a DACA request more than one year since your last grant of DACA expired or after your most recent DACA grant was terminated (at any time), your request is considered an initial request, not a renewal, under preexisting USCIS policy. Even if we convert your DACA renewal request to an initial request under this policy, your receipt notice may still show that we received it as a renewal request. USCIS can accept initial DACA requests. We will issue you a receipt notice, and we will accept your payment. However, in compliance with the court order we will not further process your request while the court order is in effect. This means we cannot approve your initial DACA request while the court order is in effect. Q19. I filed a timely DACA renewal request. It is still pending, and my prior DACA grant has expired. Is my pending DACA request still valid, and will it, along with my application for employment authorization, be processed? A19. Yes, USCIS will continue to process timely filed DACA renewal requests and associated employment authorization applications. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. However, please note that consistent with long-standing DACA policy, if your DACA expires before USCIS approves your renewal request, you do not have DACA for the period between the expiration of your prior DACA and the start of your new period of DACA. Q20. I filed a DACA renewal request and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A20. You should attend your scheduled biometrics appointment and proceed with the DACA renewal process. Advance Parole Q21. Is advance parole open for DACA recipients right now? Can I apply for advance parole? A21. Yes. USCIS will continue to accept and adjudicate applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. Q22. My advance parole application is still pending. Will USCIS process it? A22. Yes, at the present time the court orders allow USCIS to continue to process applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. If that changes, USCIS will provide updated information. Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me? A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA? A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process. Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do? A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole. If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office through the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment: A completed and signedForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos.

However, USCIS will not adjudicate your request while the court orders are in effect. Q11. If I received a receipt notice for my initial DACA request, does that mean I was granted DACA? A11. No. A receipt notice demonstrates that USCIS has received your initial DACA request. It does not indicate that we have approved your request. Q12. Will USCIS issue me a refund if I have filed an initial DACA request? A12. At this time, USCIS is not issuing refunds for pending initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court orders are in effect. USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the Southern District of Texas litigation continues. Q13. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) for my initial DACA request and that RFE or NOID is still pending. What should I do? A13. Although USCIS is prohibited from granting your initial request due to the court order, you may respond to the RFE or NOID within the requested time frame. Ensuring your filing is complete will help USCIS to make a timely decision in your case if USCIS is allowed to resume adjudication of initial DACA requests in the future. Renewals Q14. I currently have DACA, and it is about to expire. Can I file for a renewal? A14. Yes. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court orders have not affected or changed the filing process for DACA renewals. If there is a change to the effectiveness or scope of the court orders, USCIS will publish revised information. Q15. Should I renew early? A15. USCIS strongly encourages DACA recipients to file their renewal requests 120 to 150 days (4 to 5 months) before their current DACA validity period expires. Q16. Is there a chance USCIS will stop accepting DACA renewals in the future? A16. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. At this time, due to the partial stay of the Sept. 13, 2023 order, the court order has not affected the filing process for DACA renewals. Future court orders may affect USCIS’s ability to accept and approve DACA renewal requests. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. Q17. I had DACA and it expired within the last 12 months. Am I eligible to renew? A17. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its expiration, a new request is considered a renewal request, not an initial request under preexisting policy, and you may submit a request to renew your DACA. The court orders have not disturbed the filing process for DACA renewals. Q18. If it has been more than one year since my last grant of DACA expired, can I still apply for renewal? A18. If you submit a DACA request more than one year since your last grant of DACA expired or after your most recent DACA grant was terminated (at any time), your request is considered an initial request, not a renewal, under preexisting USCIS policy. Even if we convert your DACA renewal request to an initial request under this policy, your receipt notice may still show that we received it as a renewal request. USCIS can accept initial DACA requests. We will issue you a receipt notice, and we will accept your payment. However, in compliance with the court order we will not further process your request while the court order is in effect. This means we cannot approve your initial DACA request while the court order is in effect. Q19. I filed a timely DACA renewal request. It is still pending, and my prior DACA grant has expired. Is my pending DACA request still valid, and will it, along with my application for employment authorization, be processed? A19. Yes, USCIS will continue to process timely filed DACA renewal requests and associated employment authorization applications. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. However, please note that consistent with long-standing DACA policy, if your DACA expires before USCIS approves your renewal request, you do not have DACA for the period between the expiration of your prior DACA and the start of your new period of DACA. Q20. I filed a DACA renewal request and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A20. You should attend your scheduled biometrics appointment and proceed with the DACA renewal process. Advance Parole Q21. Is advance parole open for DACA recipients right now? Can I apply for advance parole? A21. Yes. USCIS will continue to accept and adjudicate applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. Q22. My advance parole application is still pending. Will USCIS process it? A22. Yes, at the present time the court orders allow USCIS to continue to process applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. If that changes, USCIS will provide updated information. Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me? A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA? A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process. Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do? A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole. If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office through the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment: A completed and signedForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos. For more information, please see theDACA Frequently Asked Questions. Employers Q27. What should I do if my current or new employee is a DACA recipient? A27. The Sept. 13, 2023 decision from the U.S. District Court from the Southern District of Texas expanded its July 16, 2021 injunction and vacatur order to the DACA Final Rule, but maintained the partial stay for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021,” so the recent court order does not disturb the grant of deferred action or the validity of work authorization for current DACA recipients. USCIS will also continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewal and associated applications for employment authorization. USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders. No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issuedguidancefor DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization. New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. SeeI-9 Centralfor more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present. The court decision is not a basis to ask any employee to show more or different documentation to verify or reverify their employment authorization on Form I-9. If you participate in E-Verify, the system can confirm identity and employment eligibility for new employees who are DACA recipients with a valid and unexpired EAD. For information about the rights of employees, please see the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division,Immigrant and Employee Rights Section'sinformation on employee rights."

          "question": "Q3. Is the DACA policy over?",
          "answer": "A3. No. While the court order does not allow USCIS to approve initial DACA requests, we are presently able to continue processing DACA renewals and associated applications because the court maintained a partial stay of its injunction for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.”. While USCIS will continue accepting initial DACA requests, the ongoing injunction and partial stay continue to prohibit DHS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021 and their accompanying requests for employment authorization. USCIS will continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewals and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and advance parole. Q4. What does this recent court decision mean if I am: A4. A current DACA recipient:If you currently have DACA and your work authorization has not expired, your DACA is still in effect, and you are eligible to request renewal at the appropriate time pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court decision does not affect the validity period of current grants of DACA, related work authorization, or advance parole.A DACA renewal requestor:Individuals requesting DACA as a renewal may continue to submit DACA renewal requests. USCIS will continue to process and issue a decision on your DACA renewal request, pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23.An initial DACA requestor:While USCIS will accept your initial DACA request, we are prohibited from granting initial requests or an accompanying application for employment authorization while the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas is in effect. If you have an initial DACA request pending, your request is on hold while the court orders are in effect. For more information about submitting initial DACA requests or DACA renewal requests, see additional questions and answers below. Q5. What is considered an “initial” DACA request? A5. An initial request for DACA includes: A first-time request for DACA;A request filed by an individual who was previously granted DACA but did not request renewal within one year of the expiration; orA request filed by an individual whose most recent DACA grant was terminated. Q6. What is considered a DACA “renewal” request? A6. A DACA renewal request includes: A request filed by an individual with a current DACA grant; orA request filed by an individual within one year of the expiration of their prior DACA grant. Q7. What does this mean if I have an initial DACA request currently pending with USCIS? A7. USCIS is not allowed to approve initial DACA requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization while the order from U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas is in effect. If you have an initial DACA request pending with USCIS, your request will remain on hold to comply with the court orders. At this time, USCIS is holding cases, rather than rejecting or closing them. While USCIS holds these cases, they will remain pending, though under the Sept. 13, 2023 court order, USCIS is not able to grant the requests that are on hold. Because these cases will remain on hold while the court order is in effect, USCIS will not issue refunds for initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court order is in effect. USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the litigation continues. Q8. How does the Sept. 13, 2023, district court decision affect the processing times for DACA requests? A8. At this time, USCIS cannot predict the effect the order may have on processing times for initial DACA requests, as DHS is prohibited from approving initial requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization under the court order. However, we maintain our goal of processing DACA renewal requests generally within 120 days and are committed to minimizing any processing delays for renewal requests. If your DACA renewal request has been pending more than 105 days, you maysubmit an inquiry onlineabout the status of your renewal request. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to: Failure to appear at an Application Support Center for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. If you do not appear or you reschedule your appointment, it will increase the processing time for your request;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orAn incomplete renewal submission or a submission with evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines, and USCIS must send a request for additional evidence or explanation. Q9. I have another type of immigration benefit application or petition pending in addition to my DACA request. Do the court orders affect my other benefit application or petition? A9. No. While the court orders prohibit USCIS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021, and their accompanying requests for employment authorization, they do not affect applications, petitions, or requests for other immigration benefits. Initials Q10. If I submit an initial DACA request on or after July 16, 2021, what will happen to my DACA request? A10. USCIS is continuing to accept initial DACA requests.

USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders. No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issuedguidancefor DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization. New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. SeeI-9 Centralfor more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present. The court decision is not a basis to ask any employee to show more or different documentation to verify or reverify their employment authorization on Form I-9. If you participate in E-Verify, the system can confirm identity and employment eligibility for new employees who are DACA recipients with a valid and unexpired EAD.

          "question": "Q6. What is considered a DACA “renewal” request?",
          "answer": "A6. A DACA renewal request includes: A request filed by an individual with a current DACA grant; orA request filed by an individual within one year of the expiration of their prior DACA grant. Q7. What does this mean if I have an initial DACA request currently pending with USCIS? A7. USCIS is not allowed to approve initial DACA requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization while the order from U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas is in effect. If you have an initial DACA request pending with USCIS, your request will remain on hold to comply with the court orders. At this time, USCIS is holding cases, rather than rejecting or closing them. While USCIS holds these cases, they will remain pending, though under the Sept. 13, 2023 court order, USCIS is not able to grant the requests that are on hold. Because these cases will remain on hold while the court order is in effect, USCIS will not issue refunds for initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court order is in effect. USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the litigation continues. Q8. How does the Sept. 13, 2023, district court decision affect the processing times for DACA requests? A8. At this time, USCIS cannot predict the effect the order may have on processing times for initial DACA requests, as DHS is prohibited from approving initial requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization under the court order. However, we maintain our goal of processing DACA renewal requests generally within 120 days and are committed to minimizing any processing delays for renewal requests. If your DACA renewal request has been pending more than 105 days, you maysubmit an inquiry onlineabout the status of your renewal request. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to: Failure to appear at an Application Support Center for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. If you do not appear or you reschedule your appointment, it will increase the processing time for your request;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orAn incomplete renewal submission or a submission with evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines, and USCIS must send a request for additional evidence or explanation. Q9. I have another type of immigration benefit application or petition pending in addition to my DACA request. Do the court orders affect my other benefit application or petition? A9. No. While the court orders prohibit USCIS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021, and their accompanying requests for employment authorization, they do not affect applications, petitions, or requests for other immigration benefits. Initials Q10. If I submit an initial DACA request on or after July 16, 2021, what will happen to my DACA request? A10. USCIS is continuing to accept initial DACA requests. If you file an initial DACA request with USCIS on or after July 16, 2021, you will receive a receipt notice, and USCIS will process your payment. However, USCIS will not adjudicate your request while the court orders are in effect. Q11. If I received a receipt notice for my initial DACA request, does that mean I was granted DACA? A11. No. A receipt notice demonstrates that USCIS has received your initial DACA request. It does not indicate that we have approved your request. Q12. Will USCIS issue me a refund if I have filed an initial DACA request? A12. At this time, USCIS is not issuing refunds for pending initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court orders are in effect. USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the Southern District of Texas litigation continues. Q13. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) for my initial DACA request and that RFE or NOID is still pending. What should I do? A13. Although USCIS is prohibited from granting your initial request due to the court order, you may respond to the RFE or NOID within the requested time frame. Ensuring your filing is complete will help USCIS to make a timely decision in your case if USCIS is allowed to resume adjudication of initial DACA requests in the future. Renewals Q14. I currently have DACA, and it is about to expire. Can I file for a renewal? A14. Yes. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court orders have not affected or changed the filing process for DACA renewals. If there is a change to the effectiveness or scope of the court orders, USCIS will publish revised information. Q15. Should I renew early? A15. USCIS strongly encourages DACA recipients to file their renewal requests 120 to 150 days (4 to 5 months) before their current DACA validity period expires. Q16. Is there a chance USCIS will stop accepting DACA renewals in the future? A16. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. At this time, due to the partial stay of the Sept. 13, 2023 order, the court order has not affected the filing process for DACA renewals. Future court orders may affect USCIS’s ability to accept and approve DACA renewal requests. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. Q17. I had DACA and it expired within the last 12 months. Am I eligible to renew? A17. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its expiration, a new request is considered a renewal request, not an initial request under preexisting policy, and you may submit a request to renew your DACA. The court orders have not disturbed the filing process for DACA renewals. Q18. If it has been more than one year since my last grant of DACA expired, can I still apply for renewal? A18. If you submit a DACA request more than one year since your last grant of DACA expired or after your most recent DACA grant was terminated (at any time), your request is considered an initial request, not a renewal, under preexisting USCIS policy. Even if we convert your DACA renewal request to an initial request under this policy, your receipt notice may still show that we received it as a renewal request. USCIS can accept initial DACA requests. We will issue you a receipt notice, and we will accept your payment. However, in compliance with the court order we will not further process your request while the court order is in effect. This means we cannot approve your initial DACA request while the court order is in effect. Q19. I filed a timely DACA renewal request. It is still pending, and my prior DACA grant has expired. Is my pending DACA request still valid, and will it, along with my application for employment authorization, be processed? A19. Yes, USCIS will continue to process timely filed DACA renewal requests and associated employment authorization applications. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. However, please note that consistent with long-standing DACA policy, if your DACA expires before USCIS approves your renewal request, you do not have DACA for the period between the expiration of your prior DACA and the start of your new period of DACA. Q20. I filed a DACA renewal request and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A20. You should attend your scheduled biometrics appointment and proceed with the DACA renewal process. Advance Parole Q21. Is advance parole open for DACA recipients right now? Can I apply for advance parole? A21. Yes. USCIS will continue to accept and adjudicate applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. Q22. My advance parole application is still pending. Will USCIS process it? A22. Yes, at the present time the court orders allow USCIS to continue to process applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. If that changes, USCIS will provide updated information. Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me? A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA? A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process. Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do? A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole. If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office through the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment: A completed and signedForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos.

You should bring the following items to your appointment: A completed and signedForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos. For more information, please see theDACA Frequently Asked Questions. Employers Q27. What should I do if my current or new employee is a DACA recipient? A27. The Sept. 13, 2023 decision from the U.S. District Court from the Southern District of Texas expanded its July 16, 2021 injunction and vacatur order to the DACA Final Rule, but maintained the partial stay for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021,” so the recent court order does not disturb the grant of deferred action or the validity of work authorization for current DACA recipients. USCIS will also continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewal and associated applications for employment authorization. USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders. No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issuedguidancefor DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization. New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. SeeI-9 Centralfor more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present. The court decision is not a basis to ask any employee to show more or different documentation to verify or reverify their employment authorization on Form I-9. If you participate in E-Verify, the system can confirm identity and employment eligibility for new employees who are DACA recipients with a valid and unexpired EAD.

          "question": "Q9. I have another type of immigration benefit application or petition pending in addition to my DACA request. Do the court orders affect my other benefit application or petition?",
          "answer": "A9. No. While the court orders prohibit USCIS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021, and their accompanying requests for employment authorization, they do not affect applications, petitions, or requests for other immigration benefits. Initials Q10. If I submit an initial DACA request on or after July 16, 2021, what will happen to my DACA request? A10. USCIS is continuing to accept initial DACA requests. If you file an initial DACA request with USCIS on or after July 16, 2021, you will receive a receipt notice, and USCIS will process your payment. However, USCIS will not adjudicate your request while the court orders are in effect. Q11. If I received a receipt notice for my initial DACA request, does that mean I was granted DACA? A11. No. A receipt notice demonstrates that USCIS has received your initial DACA request. It does not indicate that we have approved your request. Q12. Will USCIS issue me a refund if I have filed an initial DACA request? A12. At this time, USCIS is not issuing refunds for pending initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court orders are in effect. USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the Southern District of Texas litigation continues. Q13. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) for my initial DACA request and that RFE or NOID is still pending. What should I do? A13. Although USCIS is prohibited from granting your initial request due to the court order, you may respond to the RFE or NOID within the requested time frame. Ensuring your filing is complete will help USCIS to make a timely decision in your case if USCIS is allowed to resume adjudication of initial DACA requests in the future. Renewals Q14. I currently have DACA, and it is about to expire. Can I file for a renewal? A14. Yes. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court orders have not affected or changed the filing process for DACA renewals. If there is a change to the effectiveness or scope of the court orders, USCIS will publish revised information. Q15. Should I renew early? A15. USCIS strongly encourages DACA recipients to file their renewal requests 120 to 150 days (4 to 5 months) before their current DACA validity period expires. Q16. Is there a chance USCIS will stop accepting DACA renewals in the future? A16. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. At this time, due to the partial stay of the Sept. 13, 2023 order, the court order has not affected the filing process for DACA renewals. Future court orders may affect USCIS’s ability to accept and approve DACA renewal requests. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. Q17. I had DACA and it expired within the last 12 months. Am I eligible to renew? A17. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its expiration, a new request is considered a renewal request, not an initial request under preexisting policy, and you may submit a request to renew your DACA. The court orders have not disturbed the filing process for DACA renewals. Q18. If it has been more than one year since my last grant of DACA expired, can I still apply for renewal? A18. If you submit a DACA request more than one year since your last grant of DACA expired or after your most recent DACA grant was terminated (at any time), your request is considered an initial request, not a renewal, under preexisting USCIS policy. Even if we convert your DACA renewal request to an initial request under this policy, your receipt notice may still show that we received it as a renewal request. USCIS can accept initial DACA requests. We will issue you a receipt notice, and we will accept your payment. However, in compliance with the court order we will not further process your request while the court order is in effect. This means we cannot approve your initial DACA request while the court order is in effect. Q19. I filed a timely DACA renewal request. It is still pending, and my prior DACA grant has expired. Is my pending DACA request still valid, and will it, along with my application for employment authorization, be processed? A19. Yes, USCIS will continue to process timely filed DACA renewal requests and associated employment authorization applications. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. However, please note that consistent with long-standing DACA policy, if your DACA expires before USCIS approves your renewal request, you do not have DACA for the period between the expiration of your prior DACA and the start of your new period of DACA. Q20. I filed a DACA renewal request and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A20. You should attend your scheduled biometrics appointment and proceed with the DACA renewal process. Advance Parole Q21. Is advance parole open for DACA recipients right now? Can I apply for advance parole? A21. Yes. USCIS will continue to accept and adjudicate applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. Q22. My advance parole application is still pending. Will USCIS process it? A22. Yes, at the present time the court orders allow USCIS to continue to process applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. If that changes, USCIS will provide updated information. Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me? A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA? A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process. Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do? A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole. If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office through the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment: A completed and signedForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos.

Yes, at the present time the court orders allow USCIS to continue to process applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. If that changes, USCIS will provide updated information. Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me? A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA? A24.

For more information, please see theDACA Frequently Asked Questions. Employers Q27. What should I do if my current or new employee is a DACA recipient? A27. The Sept. 13, 2023 decision from the U.S. District Court from the Southern District of Texas expanded its July 16, 2021 injunction and vacatur order to the DACA Final Rule, but maintained the partial stay for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021,” so the recent court order does not disturb the grant of deferred action or the validity of work authorization for current DACA recipients. USCIS will also continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewal and associated applications for employment authorization. USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders. No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issuedguidancefor DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization. New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. SeeI-9 Centralfor more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present. The court decision is not a basis to ask any employee to show more or different documentation to verify or reverify their employment authorization on Form I-9. If you participate in E-Verify, the system can confirm identity and employment eligibility for new employees who are DACA recipients with a valid and unexpired EAD.

          "question": "Q13. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) for my initial DACA request and that RFE or NOID is still pending. What should I do?",
          "answer": "A13. Although USCIS is prohibited from granting your initial request due to the court order, you may respond to the RFE or NOID within the requested time frame. Ensuring your filing is complete will help USCIS to make a timely decision in your case if USCIS is allowed to resume adjudication of initial DACA requests in the future. Renewals Q14. I currently have DACA, and it is about to expire. Can I file for a renewal? A14. Yes. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court orders have not affected or changed the filing process for DACA renewals. If there is a change to the effectiveness or scope of the court orders, USCIS will publish revised information. Q15. Should I renew early? A15. USCIS strongly encourages DACA recipients to file their renewal requests 120 to 150 days (4 to 5 months) before their current DACA validity period expires. Q16. Is there a chance USCIS will stop accepting DACA renewals in the future? A16. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. At this time, due to the partial stay of the Sept. 13, 2023 order, the court order has not affected the filing process for DACA renewals. Future court orders may affect USCIS’s ability to accept and approve DACA renewal requests. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. Q17. I had DACA and it expired within the last 12 months. Am I eligible to renew? A17. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its expiration, a new request is considered a renewal request, not an initial request under preexisting policy, and you may submit a request to renew your DACA. The court orders have not disturbed the filing process for DACA renewals. Q18. If it has been more than one year since my last grant of DACA expired, can I still apply for renewal? A18. If you submit a DACA request more than one year since your last grant of DACA expired or after your most recent DACA grant was terminated (at any time), your request is considered an initial request, not a renewal, under preexisting USCIS policy. Even if we convert your DACA renewal request to an initial request under this policy, your receipt notice may still show that we received it as a renewal request. USCIS can accept initial DACA requests. We will issue you a receipt notice, and we will accept your payment. However, in compliance with the court order we will not further process your request while the court order is in effect. This means we cannot approve your initial DACA request while the court order is in effect. Q19. I filed a timely DACA renewal request. It is still pending, and my prior DACA grant has expired. Is my pending DACA request still valid, and will it, along with my application for employment authorization, be processed? A19. Yes, USCIS will continue to process timely filed DACA renewal requests and associated employment authorization applications. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. However, please note that consistent with long-standing DACA policy, if your DACA expires before USCIS approves your renewal request, you do not have DACA for the period between the expiration of your prior DACA and the start of your new period of DACA.

          "question": "Q17. I had DACA and it expired within the last 12 months. Am I eligible to renew?",
          "answer": "A17. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its expiration, a new request is considered a renewal request, not an initial request under preexisting policy, and you may submit a request to renew your DACA. The court orders have not disturbed the filing process for DACA renewals. Q18. If it has been more than one year since my last grant of DACA expired, can I still apply for renewal? A18. If you submit a DACA request more than one year since your last grant of DACA expired or after your most recent DACA grant was terminated (at any time), your request is considered an initial request, not a renewal, under preexisting USCIS policy. Even if we convert your DACA renewal request to an initial request under this policy, your receipt notice may still show that we received it as a renewal request. USCIS can accept initial DACA requests. We will issue you a receipt notice, and we will accept your payment. However, in compliance with the court order we will not further process your request while the court order is in effect. This means we cannot approve your initial DACA request while the court order is in effect. Q19. I filed a timely DACA renewal request. It is still pending, and my prior DACA grant has expired. Is my pending DACA request still valid, and will it, along with my application for employment authorization, be processed? A19. Yes, USCIS will continue to process timely filed DACA renewal requests and associated employment authorization applications. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information. However, please note that consistent with long-standing DACA policy, if your DACA expires before USCIS approves your renewal request, you do not have DACA for the period between the expiration of your prior DACA and the start of your new period of DACA. Q20. I filed a DACA renewal request and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A20. You should attend your scheduled biometrics appointment and proceed with the DACA renewal process. Advance Parole Q21. Is advance parole open for DACA recipients right now? Can I apply for advance parole? A21. Yes. USCIS will continue to accept and adjudicate applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. Q22. My advance parole application is still pending. Will USCIS process it? A22. Yes, at the present time the court orders allow USCIS to continue to process applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. If that changes, USCIS will provide updated information. Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me? A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA? A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry. Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do? A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process. Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do? A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole. If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office through the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment: A completed and signedForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos. For more information, please see theDACA Frequently Asked Questions. Employers Q27. What should I do if my current or new employee is a DACA recipient? A27. The Sept. 13, 2023 decision from the U.S. District Court from the Southern District of Texas expanded its July 16, 2021 injunction and vacatur order to the DACA Final Rule, but maintained the partial stay for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021,” so the recent court order does not disturb the grant of deferred action or the validity of work authorization for current DACA recipients. USCIS will also continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewal and associated applications for employment authorization. USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders. No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issuedguidancefor DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization. New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. SeeI-9 Centralfor more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present.

          "question": "Q1. What is the latest information regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)?A1. On Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Final Rule unlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021 injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” Accordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated. In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. We will also continue to accept but not process initial DACA requests. See the Memorandum and Order and Supplemental Order of Injunction.Current valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.Q2. What did the court orders say? What do they mean?A2. The Sept. 13, 2023, order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas found the DACA Final Rule unlawful, but maintained a partial stay of its order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” The partial stay allows DHS to continue to accept initial as well as DACA renewal requests, but permits DHS to approve only renewal requests and prohibits DHS from approving initial DACA requests.Therefore, consistent with this order, USCIS is continuing to accept the filing of both initial and DACA renewal requests, as well as accompanying applications for employment authorization, but will not grant initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021 and their accompanying requests for employment authorization. USCIS will grant or deny DACA renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. Current valid grants of DACA, related employment authorization and advance parole will continue to be recognized as valid.DHS will comply with the court order while it is in effect.Q3. Is the DACA policy over?A3. No. While the court order does not allow USCIS to approve initial DACA requests, we are presently able to continue processing DACA renewals and associated applications because the court maintained a partial stay of its injunction for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.”.While USCIS will continue accepting initial DACA requests, the ongoing injunction and partial stay continue to prohibit DHS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021 and their accompanying requests for employment authorization.USCIS will continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewals and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and advance parole.Q4. What does this recent court decision mean if I am:A4.A current DACA recipient: If you currently have DACA and your work authorization has not expired, your DACA is still in effect, and you are eligible to request renewal at the appropriate time pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court decision does not affect the validity period of current grants of DACA, related work authorization, or advance parole.A DACA renewal requestor: Individuals requesting DACA as a renewal may continue to submit DACA renewal requests. USCIS will continue to process and issue a decision on your DACA renewal request, pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23.An initial DACA requestor: While USCIS will accept your initial DACA request, we are prohibited from granting initial requests or an accompanying application for employment authorization while the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas is in effect. If you have an initial DACA request pending, your request is on hold while the court orders are in effect.For more information about submitting initial DACA requests or DACA renewal requests, see additional questions and answers below.Q5. What is considered an “initial” DACA request?A5. An initial request for DACA includes:A first-time request for DACA;A request filed by an individual who was previously granted DACA but did not request renewal within one year of the expiration; orA request filed by an individual whose most recent DACA grant was terminated.Q6. What is considered a DACA “renewal” request?A6. A DACA renewal request includes:A request filed by an individual with a current DACA grant; orA request filed by an individual within one year of the expiration of their prior DACA grant.Q7. What does this mean if I have an initial DACA request currently pending with USCIS?A7. USCIS is not allowed to approve initial DACA requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization while the order from U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas is in effect. If you have an initial DACA request pending with USCIS, your request will remain on hold to comply with the court orders. At this time, USCIS is holding cases, rather than rejecting or closing them. While USCIS holds these cases, they will remain pending, though under the Sept. 13, 2023 court order, USCIS is not able to grant the requests that are on hold. Because these cases will remain on hold while the court order is in effect, USCIS will not issue refunds for initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court order is in effect.USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the litigation continues.Q8. How does the Sept. 13, 2023, district court decision affect the processing times for DACA requests?A8. At this time, USCIS cannot predict the effect the order may have on processing times for initial DACA requests, as DHS is prohibited from approving initial requests or accompanying applications for employment authorization under the court order. However, we maintain our goal of processing DACA renewal requests generally within 120 days and are committed to minimizing any processing delays for renewal requests. If your DACA renewal request has been pending more than 105 days, you may submit an inquiry online about the status of your renewal request.Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to:Failure to appear at an Application Support Center for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. If you do not appear or you reschedule your appointment, it will increase the processing time for your request;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orAn incomplete renewal submission or a submission with evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines, and USCIS must send a request for additional evidence or explanation.Q9. I have another type of immigration benefit application or petition pending in addition to my DACA request. Do the court orders affect my other benefit application or petition?A9. No. While the court orders prohibit USCIS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021, and their accompanying requests for employment authorization, they do not affect applications, petitions, or requests for other immigration benefits.InitialsQ10. If I submit an initial DACA request on or after July 16, 2021, what will happen to my DACA request?A10. USCIS is continuing to accept initial DACA requests. If you file an initial DACA request with USCIS on or after July 16, 2021, you will receive a receipt notice, and USCIS will process your payment. However, USCIS will not adjudicate your request while the court orders are in effect.Q11. If I received a receipt notice for my initial DACA request, does that mean I was granted DACA?A11. No. A receipt notice demonstrates that USCIS has received your initial DACA request. It does not indicate that we have approved your request.Q12. Will USCIS issue me a refund if I have filed an initial DACA request?A12. At this time, USCIS is not issuing refunds for pending initial DACA requests that remain on hold while the court orders are in effect.USCIS may issue further guidance on this subject as the Southern District of Texas litigation continues.Q13. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) for my initial DACA request and that RFE or NOID is still pending. What should I do?A13. Although USCIS is prohibited from granting your initial request due to the court order, you may respond to the RFE or NOID within the requested time frame. Ensuring your filing is complete will help USCIS to make a timely decision in your case if USCIS is allowed to resume adjudication of initial DACA requests in the future.RenewalsQ14. I currently have DACA, and it is about to expire. Can I file for a renewal?A14. Yes. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. The court orders have not affected or changed the filing process for DACA renewals. If there is a change to the effectiveness or scope of the court orders, USCIS will publish revised information.Q15. Should I renew early?A15. USCIS strongly encourages DACA recipients to file their renewal requests 120 to 150 days (4 to 5 months) before their current DACA validity period expires.Q16. Is there a chance USCIS will stop accepting DACA renewals in the future?A16. USCIS is accepting and adjudicating renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. At this time, due to the partial stay of the Sept. 13, 2023 order, the court order has not affected the filing process for DACA renewals. Future court orders may affect USCIS’s ability to accept and approve DACA renewal requests. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information.Q17. I had DACA and it expired within the last 12 months. Am I eligible to renew?A17. If you file after your most recent DACA period expired, but within one year of its expiration, a new request is considered a renewal request, not an initial request under preexisting policy, and you may submit a request to renew your DACA. The court orders have not disturbed the filing process for DACA renewals.Q18. If it has been more than one year since my last grant of DACA expired, can I still apply for renewal?A18. If you submit a DACA request more than one year since your last grant of DACA expired or after your most recent DACA grant was terminated (at any time), your request is considered an initial request, not a renewal, under preexisting USCIS policy. Even if we convert your DACA renewal request to an initial request under this policy, your receipt notice may still show that we received it as a renewal request.USCIS can accept initial DACA requests. We will issue you a receipt notice, and we will accept your payment. However, in compliance with the court order we will not further process your request while the court order is in effect. This means we cannot approve your initial DACA request while the court order is in effect.Q19. I filed a timely DACA renewal request. It is still pending, and my prior DACA grant has expired. Is my pending DACA request still valid, and will it, along with my application for employment authorization, be processed?A19. Yes, USCIS will continue to process timely filed DACA renewal requests and associated employment authorization applications. If that changes, USCIS will publish revised information.However, please note that consistent with long-standing DACA policy, if your DACA expires before USCIS approves your renewal request, you do not have DACA for the period between the expiration of your prior DACA and the start of your new period of DACA.Q20. I filed a DACA renewal request and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do?A20. You should attend your scheduled biometrics appointment and proceed with the DACA renewal process.Advance ParoleQ21. Is advance parole open for DACA recipients right now? Can I apply for advance parole?A21. Yes. USCIS will continue to accept and adjudicate applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients.Q22. My advance parole application is still pending. Will USCIS process it?A22. Yes, at the present time the court orders allow USCIS to continue to process applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients. If that changes, USCIS will provide updated information.Q23. I was approved for advance parole. How does the Southern District of Texas decision affect me?A23. If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry.Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA?A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry.Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do?A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process.Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do?A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole. If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office through the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment:A completed and signed Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos.For more information, please see the DACA Frequently Asked Questions.EmployersQ27. What should I do if my current or new employee is a DACA recipient?A27. The Sept. 13, 2023 decision from the U.S. District Court from the Southern District of Texas expanded its July 16, 2021 injunction and vacatur order to the DACA Final Rule, but maintained the partial stay for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021,” so the recent court order does not disturb the grant of deferred action or the validity of work authorization for current DACA recipients. USCIS will also continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewal and associated applications for employment authorization. USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders.No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issued guidance for DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization.New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. See I-9 Central for more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present.The court decision is not a basis to ask any employee to show more or different documentation to verify or reverify their employment authorization on Form I-9.If you participate in E-Verify, the system can confirm identity and employment eligibility for new employees who are DACA recipients with a valid and unexpired EAD.For information about the rights of employees, please see the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Immigrant and Employee Rights Section's information on employee rights.Previous Litigation Updates:Oct. 14, 2022On Oct. 5, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision  (PDF) on the 2012 Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) policy in Texas et al. v. United States of America et al., No. 21-40680 (5th Cir. 2022). The court partially affirmed the district court’s July 2021 decision declaring the 2012 DACA policy unlawful. However, the court of appeals preserved the partial stay issued by the district court in July 2021 and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings regarding the new DHS DACA regulation published on Aug. 30, 2022 and scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 31, 2022. On Oct. 14, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued an order extending its injunction and partial stay to the DACA Final Rule.At this time, this ruling does not affect current grants of DACA for existing DACA recipients and related Employment Authorization Documents. While the DACA final rule is considered by the court, consistent with the court orders and the ongoing partial stay, we continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests, accompanying requests for employment authorization, and applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients, and will continue to accept but not process initial DACA requests. Current valid grants of DACA, related employment authorization, and advance parole will continue to be recognized as valid under the final rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related employment authorization do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.Beginning on Oct. 31, DHS will continue to grant or deny DACA renewal requests and related requests for employment authorization, in accordance with 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, pursuant to the DACA regulation. Pending requests will be adjudicated under the Final Rule beginning on Oct. 31 and do not need to be re-filed. However, under the court orders DHS remains prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and accompanying requests for employment authorization.The FAQs below provide additional information.We will provide additional updates as more information is available.July 16, 2021On July 16, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas held in State of Texas, et al., v. United States of America, et al., 1:18-CV-00068, (S.D. Texas July 16, 2021) that the DACA policy reflected in the June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum “is illegal.” The court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims; vacated the 2012 DACA memorandum; remanded the memorandum to DHS for further consideration; and issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the government’s continued administration of DACA and the reimplementation of DACA without compliance with the APA.

          "question": "Q. What is Keeping Families Together?",
          "answer": "Q. What is Keeping Families Together?A. Keeping Families Together is a process that allows certain alien spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for parole in place to enable them to apply for lawful permanent resident status without having to be separated from their families by leaving the United States for processing. Parole is an exercise of DHS’s discretionary authority under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to allow certain alien “applicants for admission” to be present in the United States on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit. The INA defines an “applicant for admission,” in relevant part, as an alien “present in the United States who has not been admitted.” Aliens who are present in the United States without admission or parole may be considered for parole in place under this process because they remain “applicants for admission.” Parole in place is available only for aliens who are present in the United States. Those who receive parole are eligible to apply for work authorization for the period of paroleQ. Which form should I file to apply for Keeping Families Together? Can I file online?A. Requestors (the alien spouse or stepchild) must fileForm I-131F, Application for Parole in Place for Certain Noncitizen Spouses and Stepchildren of U.S. Citizens, under this process. The form can only be filed online. Paper-based applications sent to USCIS by mail will be rejected (not accepted or receipted). We have created a Filing Guide for Form I-131F to help individuals as they prepare to file a request for parole in place through the online process.Q. What fee is required to file a request under Keeping Families Together (Form I-131F)?Can I obtain a fee waiver or fee exemption for this process?A. The fee to apply is $580. No fee waivers or fee exemptions are available for this process at this time.Q. Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my Form I-131F or guarantee that it will be approved. Is this true?A. No. While an attorney or accredited representative may charge a fee to prepare your request, anyone who guarantees faster processing or a positive outcome by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you. Visit ourAvoid Scamspage to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams.Please also remember that USCIS will begin accepting requests for this process on Aug. 19, 2024.Any filings received before this date will be rejected by USCIS (not accepted or receipted).Q. If my Keeping Families Together request is granted, how long will my parole period last?A. In general, if you are granted parole as an alien spouse or alien stepchild of a U.S. citizen under this process, your parole period will be valid as of the date USCIS approves your Form I-131F and will expire 3 years from that date. However, parole terminates automatically if you depart the United States. Parole may also be terminated at any time in DHS’s discretion upon a determination that parole is no longer warranted, for example, following the commission of criminal conduct.As long as your parole remains valid (that is, is not expired or terminated), you will be considered in a period of authorized stay. As a parolee, you may apply for any immigration status for which you may be otherwise eligible, including adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident."

However, there is an exception for stepchildren who entered the United States unlawfully after Nov. 1, 2020, and who otherwise meet the criteria for parole in place under this process. All such requests for parole in place are considered on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, in the exercise of discretion, taking into account the totality of the circumstances of each individual request. Q. If I meet the criteria listed above, will I be guaranteed to have my Form I-131F approved under this process? A. No. All requests under this process are considered on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of discretion, taking into account the totality of the circumstances of each individual request and evaluating whether parole is warranted as a matter of discretion for significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons. Q. If I entered the United States on a nonimmigrant visa or was admitted in another status and overstayed, am I eligible for Keeping Families Together? A. No. Parole in place is only available to an “applicant for admission,” which the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines, in relevant part, as an alien “present in the United States who has not been admitted.” This means that aliens who were last admitted on valid nonimmigrant visas or were admitted in another status but have remained in the United States beyond their authorized period of stay cannot request parole in place under this process. However, an alien who was previously “inspected and admitted” to the United States may be eligible under the law to apply for adjustment of status as an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen, if they are the beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition. For more information, please visit theAdjustment of Statuswebpage. Q. I have already departed the United States for an immigrant visa interview appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. Can I make a request for Keeping Families Together? A. No. This process is only available to aliens who are present in the United States without admission or parole. Aliens who have already departed the United States may be eligible for consular processing abroad. Q. I have Deferred Action under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Am I eligible to make a request for Keeping Families Together? A. If you are a current DACA recipient or TPS beneficiary, you may request parole in place under this process if you are currently present in the United States without admission or parole and you are otherwise eligible. However, if you previously departed the United States and re-entered with a TPS Travel Authorization Document or an Advance Parole Document, you are not eligible for parole in place under this process because you have already been admitted or paroled into the United States. If you are in a valid period of parole at the time your DACA renewal request is adjudicated, USCIS will deny your DACA renewal request as a matter of discretion. Q. I once had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but my DACA or TPS has lapsed. Am I eligible to make a request for Keeping Families Together? A. If your DACA or TPS has lapsed, you may request parole in place under this process if you are currently present in the United States without admission or parole. However, if you previously departed the United States and re-entered with a TPS Travel Authorization Document or an Advance Parole Document, you are not eligible for parole in place under this process because you have already been admitted or paroled into the United States. If you submit a DACA renewal request while in a valid period of parole or are in a valid period of parole at the time your DACA renewal request is adjudicated, USCIS will deny your DACA renewal request as a matter of discretion. Q. Will I be able to request re-parole (a new period of parole) and renew my employment authorization when the duration of my parole under Keeping Families Together ends? A. DHS is not planning a re-parole process. If you do not apply for adjustment of status or receive another immigration status before your period of parole expires, you may begin to accrue or resume accruingunlawful presence. Any parole-based employment authorization granted by USCIS (category (c)(11)) will also generally expire at the same time your parole period expires. However, if you file for adjustment of status, you may request employment authorization on the basis of your pending adjustment application, Form I-485 (category (c)(9)). If approved, you can receive employment authorization with a five-year validity date under category (c)(9). If your parole under this process is granted, you should not delay in filing their subsequent I-130 petition and I-485 application."

          "question": "Q. I have Deferred Action under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Am I eligible to make a request for Keeping Families Together?",
          "answer": "A. If you are a current DACA recipient or TPS beneficiary, you may request parole in place under this process if you are currently present in the United States without admission or parole and you are otherwise eligible. However, if you previously departed the United States and re-entered with a TPS Travel Authorization Document or an Advance Parole Document, you are not eligible for parole in place under this process because you have already been admitted or paroled into the United States. If you are in a valid period of parole at the time your DACA renewal request is adjudicated, USCIS will deny your DACA renewal request as a matter of discretion. Q. I once had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but my DACA or TPS has lapsed. Am I eligible to make a request for Keeping Families Together? A. If your DACA or TPS has lapsed, you may request parole in place under this process if you are currently present in the United States without admission or parole. However, if you previously departed the United States and re-entered with a TPS Travel Authorization Document or an Advance Parole Document, you are not eligible for parole in place under this process because you have already been admitted or paroled into the United States. If you submit a DACA renewal request while in a valid period of parole or are in a valid period of parole at the time your DACA renewal request is adjudicated, USCIS will deny your DACA renewal request as a matter of discretion. Q. Will I be able to request re-parole (a new period of parole) and renew my employment authorization when the duration of my parole under Keeping Families Together ends? A. DHS is not planning a re-parole process. If you do not apply for adjustment of status or receive another immigration status before your period of parole expires, you may begin to accrue or resume accruingunlawful presence. Any parole-based employment authorization granted by USCIS (category (c)(11)) will also generally expire at the same time your parole period expires. However, if you file for adjustment of status, you may request employment authorization on the basis of your pending adjustment application, Form I-485 (category (c)(9)). If approved, you can receive employment authorization with a five-year validity date under category (c)(9). If your parole under this process is granted, you should not delay in filing their subsequent I-130 petition and I-485 application."

          "answer": "A. You (the alien spouse or stepchild) must submitForm I-131F, Application for Parole in Place for Certain Noncitizen Spouses and Stepchildren of U.S. Citizens, online with the applicable filing fee of $580. You may not file for this process using a paper form. Any paper filing received by USCIS will be rejected (not accepted or receipted) and you will have to file again to have your request considered. You must submit with your online request documentation establishing that you meet all eligibility criteria and evidence of any additional factors you would like USCIS to consider. Each requestor, including stepchildren, must have their own USCIS online account to prepare and file the Form I-131F individually. A parent or legal guardian may create an online account for their minor child if the purpose is to submit a form on behalf of the minor. If a parent or legal guardian is not available, a primary caregiver or legal assistance provider may also help a child create their own USCIS online account.

          "question": "Q. Is there a deadline after which USCIS will no longer accept requests for Keeping Families Together?",
          "answer": "A. There is no filing deadline for this process. Q. What evidence can I submit to show my continuous physical presence in the United States since June 17, 2014 (if I am the spouse of a U.S. citizen), or since June 17, 2024 (if I am the stepchild of a U.S. citizen)? A. If you are making a request for this process as the spouse of a U.S. citizen, you must submit documentation that shows you have been continuously physically present in the United States from June 17, 2014, up until the time of filing your request, to meet the continuous physical presence requirement. If you are the stepchild of a U.S. citizen, you must submit documentation that shows you have been continuously physically present in the United States from June 17, 2024, until the time of filing your request. You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence. It is helpful to submit evidence of your physical presence during at least each year of the required period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether you have established by a preponderance of the evidence that you were continuously physically present in the United States for the required period. If gaps in your documentation raise questions about whether you were continuously physically present in the United States for the required period, we may issue, at our discretion, a Request for Evidence to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous physical presence. Q. What evidence can I submit to show I merit a favorable exercise of discretion for this process? A. Our decision whether to grant your request is a discretionary, case-by-case determination. Even if you establish that you have met all the criteria for eligibility, we will examine the totality of the circumstances in your individual case to determine whether your request should be granted based on a significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons and whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion based on a review of all positive and negative factors present in your case. If there are negative factors that outweigh the positive factors presented by the evidence, we may deny your request. If you have a final unexecuted removal order or non-disqualifying criminal history, you may provide additional documentation that you believe demonstrates that you merit a favorable exercise of discretion. Such documentation may relate to, but is not limited to: Community ties;Your particular vulnerability related to advanced or young age;Length of presence in the United States;Existence of a mental or physical condition or illness requiring care or treatment in the United States;Your status as a parent or caregiver of a U.S. citizen child, or elderly parent or in-law;Your status as a caregiver for an individual with disabilities, including a U.S. citizen parent, in-law, or sibling;Your status as a victim or witness of a crime, or civil rights violation, or labor rights violation under investigation by a labor agency;Effect on other family members, including family members who are U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents; orOther positive factors about which you wish to provide information. This is a non-exhaustive list of factors; we may consider any relevant factors in the discretionary analysis, including mitigating factors that relate to the specific criminal conduct or prior removal order at issue. Q. Will USCIS verify documents or statements I provide to support my request? A. USCIS has the authority to verify documents, facts, and statements provided to support immigration requests, including requests under this process. We may contact relatives, educational institutions, other government agencies, or other entities to verify information. In addition, USCIS will conduct background and security checks. If USCIS determines you have made a material misrepresentation or engaged in fraud as part of your request, your request will be denied, and you may be ineligible or inadmissible for other immigration benefits in the future. You may also be subject to criminal prosecution. Q. Am I required to demonstrate that I am not inadmissible in order to qualify for this process? A. No. Parole is neither an admission to the United States nor a determination of admissibility. As a result, requestors do not need to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible as part of this process. However, USCIS may consider facts and circumstances that may give rise to one’s inadmissibility in making the case-by-case discretionary parole determination, and requestors who subsequently apply for adjustment of status will be evaluated for admissibility at that stage. Q. Will I be subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility when I request parole in place? A. No. Parole is neither an admission to the United States nor a determination of admissibility. As a result, requestors do not need to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the public charge ground of inadmissibility as part of this process. However, requestors who subsequently apply for adjustment of status will be evaluated for admissibility, including the public charge ground of inadmissibility, at that stage. Q. Will the information I share in my Keeping Families Together request be used for immigration enforcement purposes? A. DHS generally will not use information contained in a request under this process for the purpose of initiating immigration enforcement action, unless DHS determines, in its discretion, that you pose a threat to national security, public safety, or border security. This process does not preclude DHS from, in its discretionary authority, taking enforcement actions in accordance with the INA and consistent with governing policies and practices, against aliens who may be eligible or who have pending requests for parole under this process. DHS may disclose information in the request to national security and/or law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than initiation of immigration enforcement proceedings. These purposes include assistance in the consideration of parole, identification or prevention of fraudulent claims, investigation of a possible national security threat, investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, or as otherwise needed, consistent with statutory authorities, obligations, and restrictions, as well as governing privacy and information-sharing policies. Q. If my request is pending and I am encountered by CBP or ICE, will I be placed into removal proceedings? A. The Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF)direct DHS to focus its limited resources on aliens who pose a threat to our national security, public safety, or border security. Thoseguidelinesremain in effect. Filing a request under this process, or eligibility to file a request for parole in place under this process, does not prevent CBP or ICE from taking enforcement action against an individual when otherwise appropriate under applicable law and policy. Q. If USCIS denies my request, will I be placed in removal proceedings? A. If we deny your request under this process, we generally will not issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) or refer your case to ICE for possible enforcement action solely based on our denial. USCIS maintains discretion to issue an NTA or refer the case to ICE for possible enforcement action consistent with governing policies and practices, including initiating immigration enforcement proceedings based on a threat to national security, public safety or border security*. *NOTE: Consistent with the Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF), an alien who poses a threat to border security will be generally disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this process. However, there is an exception for stepchildren who entered the United States unlawfully after Nov. 1, 2020, and who otherwise meet the criteria for parole in place under this process."

USCIS maintains discretion to issue an NTA or refer the case to ICE for possible enforcement action consistent with governing policies and practices, including initiating immigration enforcement proceedings based on a threat to national security, public safety or border security*. *NOTE: Consistent with the Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF), an alien who poses a threat to border security will be generally disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this process. However, there is an exception for stepchildren who entered the United States unlawfully after Nov. 1, 2020, and who otherwise meet the criteria for parole in place under this process."

          "question": "Q. Will I be subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility when I request parole in place?",
          "answer": "A. No. Parole is neither an admission to the United States nor a determination of admissibility. As a result, requestors do not need to demonstrate that they are not inadmissible under the public charge ground of inadmissibility as part of this process. However, requestors who subsequently apply for adjustment of status will be evaluated for admissibility, including the public charge ground of inadmissibility, at that stage. Q. Will the information I share in my Keeping Families Together request be used for immigration enforcement purposes? A. DHS generally will not use information contained in a request under this process for the purpose of initiating immigration enforcement action, unless DHS determines, in its discretion, that you pose a threat to national security, public safety, or border security. This process does not preclude DHS from, in its discretionary authority, taking enforcement actions in accordance with the INA and consistent with governing policies and practices, against aliens who may be eligible or who have pending requests for parole under this process. DHS may disclose information in the request to national security and/or law enforcement agencies, including ICE and CBP, for purposes other than initiation of immigration enforcement proceedings. These purposes include assistance in the consideration of parole, identification or prevention of fraudulent claims, investigation of a possible national security threat, investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense, or as otherwise needed, consistent with statutory authorities, obligations, and restrictions, as well as governing privacy and information-sharing policies. Q. If my request is pending and I am encountered by CBP or ICE, will I be placed into removal proceedings? A. The Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF)direct DHS to focus its limited resources on aliens who pose a threat to our national security, public safety, or border security. Thoseguidelinesremain in effect. Filing a request under this process, or eligibility to file a request for parole in place under this process, does not prevent CBP or ICE from taking enforcement action against an individual when otherwise appropriate under applicable law and policy. Q. If USCIS denies my request, will I be placed in removal proceedings? A.

          "question": "Q. What is considered a legally valid marriage?",
          "answer": "A. USCIS will generally recognize a marriage as valid for purposes of Keeping Families Together if it is legally valid in the place where the marriage was celebrated, the parties to the marriage were legally free to marry, and the marriage is not contrary to the public policy of the United States or of the state where the couple resides. The place of celebration is generally where the ceremony took place or where the officiant of the ceremony was located and where the marriage certificate was issued. Even if a marriage is valid in the place of celebration, there are circumstances where USCIS may not recognize a marriage relationship as valid for the purposes of this process, consistent with existing case law and policies for family-based immigrant visa petitions and other benefits. Examples of the types of marital relationships that USCIS generally willnotrecognize for the purposes of this process include, but are not limited to: Civil unions, domestic partnerships, or other relationships that do not confer the same legal rights and responsibilities to the parties as a marriage recognized by a civil authority;Marriages that are contrary to public policy in the United States; andMarriages where one or both parties to the marriage are not legally free to marry or have not given consent to the marriage. Q. Are common law marriages considered legally valid marriages for purposes of Keeping Families Together? A. USCIS recognizes common law marriages in adjudicating immigration benefits in certain circumstances and will similarly recognize them for purposes of Keeping Families Together if: The parties live in a jurisdiction that recognizes common law marriages;The parties meet the qualifications for common law marriage for that jurisdiction;The marriage is valid and recognized by the jurisdiction in which the marriage was established; andThe marriage was established on or before June 17, 2024. If you live in a different state than where you entered into your marriage, you may still be eligible. Some states may recognize a common law marriage contracted in another state even if the recognizing state does not accept common law marriage as a means for its own residents to contract marriage. If you are requesting parole in place under Keeping Families Together on the basis of a common law marriage, you should submit a copy of the statute, regulation, or case law that states the requirements in that jurisdiction for establishing a common law marriage. You should also submit evidence that demonstrates you met the requirements in the jurisdiction for establishing a common law marriage on or before June 17, 2024. USCIS will review the laws of the relevant jurisdiction on common law marriages and the evidence you submit to determine whether you and your spouse should be considered to be married for purposes of this process and when the marriage was established. Q. If my U.S. citizen spouse has died, am I still eligible for Keeping Families Together? A. If your U.S. citizen spouse has died and you have not remarried, you may still be eligible for the Keeping Families Together process. However, to be eligible for immigrant visa petition approval and eligible to apply to adjust status as a widow(er) of a U.S. citizen, you must meet other eligibility requirements.

          "answer": "A. To be considered for this process as a stepchild of a U.S. citizen, you must have been under 21 and unmarried as of June 17, 2024. In addition, the legally valid marriage between your alien parent and your U.S. citizen stepparent must have occurred on or before June 17, 2024, and before your 18th birthday. Q. I was under 21 and unmarried as of June 17, 2024, and am the stepchild of a U.S. citizen. Am I eligible for Keeping Families Together? A. Yes, if you meet all other criteria.

If you pursue adjustment of status, USCIS will determine whether, at the time of the Form I-130 filing, you met the INA definition of a child or of a son or daughter of a U.S. citizen. For more information on family-based immigration processes, please refer toUSCIS resources. Q. If I am a stepchild of a U.S. citizen, do I have to file my own individual request? A. Yes. You must file your own Form I-131F, pay the $580 filing fee, and submit documentation establishing you meet the criteria for this process. Parents or legal guardians may sign and submit a request on behalf of a minor child under the age of 14. Children may also sign a request for themselves. If a parent is filling out the information on behalf of their child, the parent must include their information in the “preparer” section of Form I-131F. Q. If I am making a request for this process as the stepchild of a U.S. citizen, must I have at least 10 years of continuous physical presence? A. No. As a stepchild of a U.S. citizen, you must demonstrate continuous physical presence in the United States since at least June 17, 2024, through the date of filing. You are not required to demonstrate that you have been continuously physically present for 10 years before June 17, 2024. Q.

You may be eligible for this process if your alien parent or U.S. citizen stepparent is deceased. However, a grant of parole does not guarantee eligibility for immigrant visa petition approval or adjustment of status. Q. If I am granted parole in place under Keeping Families Together as a stepchild of a U.S. citizen, what will happen to me if my parent and U.S. citizen stepparent divorce before I am able to apply to adjust my status (before my parole period ends)? A. If your alien parent and U.S. citizen stepparent divorce, you may continue to be eligible as an immigrant petition beneficiary and for adjustment of status if your stepparent demonstrates an ongoing bona fide parent-child relationship to you. This might include evidence that you and your stepparent reside together or that your stepparent provides financial and emotional support for your care."

          "question": "Q. Do brief departures from the United States interrupt the continuous physical presence threshold criterion? Also, if I am granted parole, will a brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States affect my eligibility for adjustment of status?",
          "answer": "A. No. A brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous physical presence in the United States during the required period for the purpose of Keeping Families Together. For the purpose of this process, a brief, casual, and innocent absence means an absence from the United States that took place prior to June 17, 2024, and: The absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence;The absence was not because of a departure under an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;The absence was not because of an order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure before you were placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings;The purpose of the absence and your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law; andYou are not a threat to border security (apprehended while attempting to unlawfully enter the United States on/after Nov. 1, 2020, or apprehended in the United States after unlawfully entering after Nov. 1, 2020). See DHS’s Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF). However, to be eligible for adjustment of status, you must be admissible to the United States. If you were unlawfully present in the United States before your departure and absence from the United States, you may be inadmissible to the United States under INA section 212(a)(9)(B) or (C) and ineligible for adjustment of status under INA section 245(a), even after a grant of parole in place, depending on certain factual circumstances, including how long you were unlawfully present in the United States before your departure and whether you departed after being ordered removed from the United States. If you were removed or departed the United States under an outstanding order of exclusion, deportation, or removal and subsequently reentered without being admitted or paroled, USCIS will not grant you parole in place under Keeping Families Together, regardless of the date of your removal, departure, or reentry. More information concerning unlawful presence is available on theUSCIS website, including information about the availability of a waiver for inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(B) or consent to reapply for admission after spending 10 years outside the United States for inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(C). Determining if you are inadmissible after accruing unlawful presence can be complex. If you need help or legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. You can find information about authorized legal services on ourAvoid Scamspage. CAUTION:If you need to travel during your parole period or while your adjustment of status application is pending, pleasecarefully review the “Travel” section of these FAQs below, which refers to obtaining an Advance Parole document prior to departing the United States."

          "question": "Q. I am currently in removal proceedings. Am I eligible for Keeping Families Together?",
          "answer": "A. Yes. If you are otherwise eligible for parole in place under this process, including that you are present in the United States without admission or parole, USCIS will consider your request if you are currently in removal proceedings before an immigration judge (also called INA Section 240 proceedings), including if your case is on appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals, or if you have a case that is administratively closed. This includes if you were released on bond or on your own recognizance. However, USCIS will consider any relevant information related to your removal proceedings, and any other relevant factors, in determining whether to grant parole in place as a matter of discretion. If you constitute an enforcement priority based on national security, public safety, or border security* concerns/issues, USCIS will deny your request for parole in place under this process. *NOTE:Consistent with the Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF), an alien who poses a threat to border security will be generally disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this process. However, there is an exception for stepchildren who entered the United States unlawfully after Nov. 1, 2020, and who otherwise meet the criteria for parole in place under this process. Q. How do I find out if I am in removal proceedings or have a removal order? A. If you do not know if you have a removal order or are currently in immigration proceedings, you can use your A-Number to look up your immigration court case status athttps://acis.eoir.justice.gov/en/. You can also call the EOIR hotline: 800-898-7180 / 304-625-2050 / TDD: 800-828-1120. ‘A-Number” refers to the immigration file number provided to you by U.S. immigration officials. It is an eight or nine-digit number that begins with an “A” and can be found on correspondence you have received from DHS or USCIS or on immigration court records. Q. I have a final removal order but have not departed or been removed from the United States or have not departed after a grant of voluntary departure. Am I eligible for the Keeping Families Together process? A. You may request parole in place under Keeping Families Together if you otherwise meet the criteria, but if you have a final removal order and have not departed the United States after the entry of that order, or have not been removed from the United States—sometimes called an “unexecuted” removal order (including a removal order that resulted from failure to depart after a grant of voluntary departure)—you are subject to a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility for this process. Q. If my removal proceedings were administratively closed, am I eligible for Keeping Families Together? A. Yes. USCIS may grant your parole in place request, if you otherwise meet the eligibility criteria and merit a favorable exercise of discretion. However, to apply for adjustment of status, you may need to seek re-calendaring, termination, or dismissal of your removal proceedings, depending on your circumstances. Q. I was removed from the United States with a final order of removal and reentered without being admitted or paroled. Am I eligible for parole in place under Keeping Families Together? A. No. If you were removed or departed the United States under an outstanding order of exclusion, deportation, or removal and subsequently reentered without being admitted or paroled, USCIS will not grant you parole in place under Keeping Families Together, regardless of the date of your removal, departure, or reentry. Q. What factors will USCIS consider in determining whether I have rebutted the presumption of ineligibility for parole in place because I have a final unexecuted removal order? A. USCIS will evaluate, in the exercise of its discretion on a case-by-case basis, all positive and negative factors presented in your case, including the facts and circumstances underlying the unexecuted final removal order, in determining whether you overcome the presumption of ineligibility and be granted parole in place. Examples of information that may be relevant to overcoming the presumption of ineligibility include, but are not limited to: Circumstances surrounding your removal order, such as:Lack of proper notice;Your age when the removal order was issued;Lack of counsel, ineffective assistance of counsel or being a victim of fraud in connection with immigration representation;Other extenuating factors or considerations, such as:Language access issues;Status as a victim of domestic violence;A physical or mental condition requiring care or treatment;Other extenuating personal factors, such as requestor’s limited resources (for example, a lack of housing that would have affected the requestor’s ability to appear);Other mitigating factors. Q. I was granted parole in place under this process but am in removal proceedings before an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals or had my removal proceedings administratively closed. Can I apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident with USCIS? A. Not immediately. If you want to file for adjustment of status with USCIS, you must ask the immigration judge to first terminate or dismiss your removal proceedings. Even if USCIS grants you parole in place, the immigration court generally retains sole jurisdiction over your application for adjustment of status (Form I-485) as long as you remain in removal proceedings, including if your removal proceedings were administratively closed. If you are in INA section 240 proceedings, you should contact the appropriate local ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) field office where your removal case is located and provide information about your approved parole request.

          "question": "Q. What impact does having a criminal conviction have on eligibility for this process?",
          "answer": "A. All felony offenses will be disqualifying under this process. Convictions for the following offenses are also disqualifying regardless of whether the conviction was a felony or misdemeanor. DHS reserves its discretion to determine that other offenses are disqualifying, even if not listed. Murder, torture, rape, or sexual abuse;Offenses involving firearms, explosive materials, or destructive devices;Engaging in activities relating to peonage, slavery, involuntary servitude, and trafficking in persons;Aggravated assault;Offenses relating to child pornography, sexual abuse or exploitation of minors, or solicitation of minors;Domestic violence, stalking, child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment; andControlled substance offenses (other than simple possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana). All other criminal convictions not listed above, excluding minor traffic offenses, will result in a presumption of ineligibility for this process. To overcome the presumption of ineligibility, you must provide documentation demonstrating positive factors that can be considered in overcoming this presumption and showing that you warrant a favorable exercise of discretion. You should include copies of arrest records and certified court dispositions for each arrest or criminal charge, as well as evidence that you completed your sentence, if applicable. Even if you establish that you have met all the criteria for eligibility, and have rebutted the presumption of ineligibility, USCIS will examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether your request should be granted as a matter of discretion for significant public benefit or urgent humanitarian reasons. Q. If I have a conviction for a felony offense, am I eligible for this process? A. No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, you are not eligible for this process, and we will deny your request. Q. What offenses qualify as felonies? A. A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of this process. Q. I have pending criminal charges. Am I eligible for this process while the charges remain pending? A. No. If you have been charged with any criminal offense and the charges remain pending, we will deny your request and not refund your filing fee. You may make a request for this process once your charges are resolved. However, if your criminal charges result in a conviction, and you are convicted of a crime that renders you ineligible for this process, your request will be denied. If your charges result in a conviction and the conviction does not render you ineligible for this process, the conviction will result in a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility, which may be overcome by demonstrating positive factors that outweigh the negative factors in your case. You should include copies of arrest records and certified court dispositions for each arrest or criminal charge, as well as evidence that you completed your sentence, if applicable. USCIS will weigh the seriousness of the conviction against the positive factors and any other relevant information in each individual case. We will consider all criminal history in determining whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion under this process. Q. What qualifies as a national security, public safety, or border security concern? A. If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request indicates that you pose a public safety, national security, or border security concern, we will not grant your parole request. Indicators of national security concerns include, but are not limited to, participation in activities that threaten the United States. Indicators of public safety concerns include, but are not limited to, serious criminal conduct and criminal history. Indicators of border security concerns include apprehension following entry into the United States without authorization on or after Nov. 1, 2020; however, stepchildren who otherwise meet the eligibility criteria will not be disqualified if they entered on or after Nov. 1, 2020. Q. Are dismissed, expunged, vacated, pardoned, deferred, annulled, invalidated, withheld, or sealed convictions subject to the presumption of ineligibility? A. Yes. Convictions that were, for example, dismissed, expunged, vacated, pardoned, deferred, annulled, invalidated, withheld, or sealed will still create a presumption of ineligibility for purposes of this process, even if they may no longer constitute convictions for immigration purposes. You may be able to overcome this presumption, however, depending on the specific facts of your case, including but not limited to the fact that the conviction was expunged or vacated under state law, the reasons for the expungement or vacatur, the nature of the underlying offense, your age at the time of the commission of the underlying offense, and any other relevant facts surrounding the original conviction. In addition, USCIS may consider your entire criminal history, if any, along with other facts to determine, whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. NOTE: If you were never convicted (for example, you were only arrested), you are not subject to the presumption of ineligibility. Q. If I have a criminal conviction that makes me presumptively ineligible for Keeping Families Together, how can I overcome that presumption? A. The presumption may be rebutted on a case-by-case basis by providing evidence that demonstrates positive and mitigating factors that overcome the presumption. USCIS will weigh the seriousness of the conviction against mitigating factors relating to the conviction as well as other positive factors that suggest you merit a favorable exercise of discretion. The weight of the presumption will be guided by the nature and seriousness of the conviction. A less serious conviction, or a conviction that does not indicate you are a public safety concern, will carry less weight and can be more easily rebutted. In adjudicating parole in place requests on an individualized, case-by-case basis, the nature and seriousness of the conviction will determine the evidence needed to overcome it. You should submit a detailed statement explaining the circumstances of the conviction, any mitigating factors, and any positive factors you want USCIS to consider and any other evidence you think may support your case. USCIS may request additional evidence from you if the evidence you submit initially is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of ineligibility. Examples of factors we will consider in determining whether the presumption of ineligibility based on a criminal conviction can be overcome – such as the age and nature of the conviction, as well as positive factors about the requestor – are described below. Q. What factors will USCIS consider to determine whether I have overcome the presumption of ineligibility because of a criminal conviction? A. Factors that can be considered in overcoming the presumption of ineligibility due to a criminal conviction may include, but are not limited to: Age of the conviction(s) (remoteness in time);Your age at the time of the offense and conviction, including whether you were a juvenile at the time of the offense;Sentence or penalty imposed;Evidence of subsequent rehabilitation;Nature of the conviction, including whether the conduct at issue was non-violent;Whether the conviction was an isolated offense when considered against the rest of your history, if any (including consideration of whether multiple criminal convictions were on the same date and may have arisen out of the same act, omission or scheme of conduct);Existence of a mental or physical condition that may have contributed to the criminal conduct;Your particular vulnerability, including any physical or mental condition requiring treatment or care in the United States;Your status as a victim of criminal activity, including domestic violence, particularly if related to the criminal conduct at issue;Your status, or that of your U.S. citizen spouse, as a current or former member of the U.S. military;Your status as the primary caregiver for a U.S. citizen child or elderly U.S. citizen parent or in-law;Your good character, such as property ties, business ties, or value and service to the community; orOther factors USCIS considers in its exercise of discretion. Q. If I have a misdemeanor conviction for driving without a license, or driving with an expired license, will it make me ineligible for this process? A. No. Misdemeanor convictions for minor traffic offenses, including driving without a license or driving with an expired license, will not make you ineligible for this process or create a presumption of ineligibility. Q. Are juvenile delinquency dispositions subject to the presumption of ineligibility? A. Yes. Juvenile delinquency dispositions will create a presumption of ineligibility for purposes of this process, even if they do not constitute convictions for immigration purposes. However, the factors considered when determining whether the presumption has been overcome, such as the nature of the underlying offense, your age at the time of the commission of the underlying offense, the length of time that has passed since the adjudication, and any other relevant facts surrounding the offense may be especially relevant in such cases. In addition, we may consider your entire criminal history, if any, along with other positive factors to determine, whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. If you cannot provide the record of the disposition because it is sealed or because State law prohibits its disclosure (even to you), USCIS still may request a statement or other information from you to determine whether the presumption has been overcome and a favorable exercise of discretion is otherwise warranted."

          "question": "Q. If I have a conviction for a felony offense, am I eligible for this process?",
          "answer": "A. No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, you are not eligible for this process, and we will deny your request. Q. What offenses qualify as felonies? A. A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of this process. Q. I have pending criminal charges. Am I eligible for this process while the charges remain pending? A. No. If you have been charged with any criminal offense and the charges remain pending, we will deny your request and not refund your filing fee. You may make a request for this process once your charges are resolved. However, if your criminal charges result in a conviction, and you are convicted of a crime that renders you ineligible for this process, your request will be denied. If your charges result in a conviction and the conviction does not render you ineligible for this process, the conviction will result in a rebuttable presumption of ineligibility, which may be overcome by demonstrating positive factors that outweigh the negative factors in your case. You should include copies of arrest records and certified court dispositions for each arrest or criminal charge, as well as evidence that you completed your sentence, if applicable. USCIS will weigh the seriousness of the conviction against the positive factors and any other relevant information in each individual case. We will consider all criminal history in determining whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion under this process. Q. What qualifies as a national security, public safety, or border security concern? A. If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request indicates that you pose a public safety, national security, or border security concern, we will not grant your parole request. Indicators of national security concerns include, but are not limited to, participation in activities that threaten the United States. Indicators of public safety concerns include, but are not limited to, serious criminal conduct and criminal history. Indicators of border security concerns include apprehension following entry into the United States without authorization on or after Nov. 1, 2020; however, stepchildren who otherwise meet the eligibility criteria will not be disqualified if they entered on or after Nov. 1, 2020. Q. Are dismissed, expunged, vacated, pardoned, deferred, annulled, invalidated, withheld, or sealed convictions subject to the presumption of ineligibility? A. Yes. Convictions that were, for example, dismissed, expunged, vacated, pardoned, deferred, annulled, invalidated, withheld, or sealed will still create a presumption of ineligibility for purposes of this process, even if they may no longer constitute convictions for immigration purposes. You may be able to overcome this presumption, however, depending on the specific facts of your case, including but not limited to the fact that the conviction was expunged or vacated under state law, the reasons for the expungement or vacatur, the nature of the underlying offense, your age at the time of the commission of the underlying offense, and any other relevant facts surrounding the original conviction. In addition, USCIS may consider your entire criminal history, if any, along with other facts to determine, whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. NOTE: If you were never convicted (for example, you were only arrested), you are not subject to the presumption of ineligibility. Q. If I have a criminal conviction that makes me presumptively ineligible for Keeping Families Together, how can I overcome that presumption? A. The presumption may be rebutted on a case-by-case basis by providing evidence that demonstrates positive and mitigating factors that overcome the presumption. USCIS will weigh the seriousness of the conviction against mitigating factors relating to the conviction as well as other positive factors that suggest you merit a favorable exercise of discretion. The weight of the presumption will be guided by the nature and seriousness of the conviction. A less serious conviction, or a conviction that does not indicate you are a public safety concern, will carry less weight and can be more easily rebutted. In adjudicating parole in place requests on an individualized, case-by-case basis, the nature and seriousness of the conviction will determine the evidence needed to overcome it. You should submit a detailed statement explaining the circumstances of the conviction, any mitigating factors, and any positive factors you want USCIS to consider and any other evidence you think may support your case. USCIS may request additional evidence from you if the evidence you submit initially is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of ineligibility. Examples of factors we will consider in determining whether the presumption of ineligibility based on a criminal conviction can be overcome – such as the age and nature of the conviction, as well as positive factors about the requestor – are described below. Q. What factors will USCIS consider to determine whether I have overcome the presumption of ineligibility because of a criminal conviction? A. Factors that can be considered in overcoming the presumption of ineligibility due to a criminal conviction may include, but are not limited to: Age of the conviction(s) (remoteness in time);Your age at the time of the offense and conviction, including whether you were a juvenile at the time of the offense;Sentence or penalty imposed;Evidence of subsequent rehabilitation;Nature of the conviction, including whether the conduct at issue was non-violent;Whether the conviction was an isolated offense when considered against the rest of your history, if any (including consideration of whether multiple criminal convictions were on the same date and may have arisen out of the same act, omission or scheme of conduct);Existence of a mental or physical condition that may have contributed to the criminal conduct;Your particular vulnerability, including any physical or mental condition requiring treatment or care in the United States;Your status as a victim of criminal activity, including domestic violence, particularly if related to the criminal conduct at issue;Your status, or that of your U.S. citizen spouse, as a current or former member of the U.S. military;Your status as the primary caregiver for a U.S. citizen child or elderly U.S. citizen parent or in-law;Your good character, such as property ties, business ties, or value and service to the community; orOther factors USCIS considers in its exercise of discretion. Q. If I have a misdemeanor conviction for driving without a license, or driving with an expired license, will it make me ineligible for this process? A. No. Misdemeanor convictions for minor traffic offenses, including driving without a license or driving with an expired license, will not make you ineligible for this process or create a presumption of ineligibility. Q. Are juvenile delinquency dispositions subject to the presumption of ineligibility? A. Yes. Juvenile delinquency dispositions will create a presumption of ineligibility for purposes of this process, even if they do not constitute convictions for immigration purposes. However, the factors considered when determining whether the presumption has been overcome, such as the nature of the underlying offense, your age at the time of the commission of the underlying offense, the length of time that has passed since the adjudication, and any other relevant facts surrounding the offense may be especially relevant in such cases.

Factors that can be considered in overcoming the presumption of ineligibility due to a criminal conviction may include, but are not limited to: Age of the conviction(s) (remoteness in time);Your age at the time of the offense and conviction, including whether you were a juvenile at the time of the offense;Sentence or penalty imposed;Evidence of subsequent rehabilitation;Nature of the conviction, including whether the conduct at issue was non-violent;Whether the conviction was an isolated offense when considered against the rest of your history, if any (including consideration of whether multiple criminal convictions were on the same date and may have arisen out of the same act, omission or scheme of conduct);Existence of a mental or physical condition that may have contributed to the criminal conduct;Your particular vulnerability, including any physical or mental condition requiring treatment or care in the United States;Your status as a victim of criminal activity, including domestic violence, particularly if related to the criminal conduct at issue;Your status, or that of your U.S. citizen spouse, as a current or former member of the U.S. military;Your status as the primary caregiver for a U.S. citizen child or elderly U.S. citizen parent or in-law;Your good character, such as property ties, business ties, or value and service to the community; orOther factors USCIS considers in its exercise of discretion. Q. If I have a misdemeanor conviction for driving without a license, or driving with an expired license, will it make me ineligible for this process? A. No. Misdemeanor convictions for minor traffic offenses, including driving without a license or driving with an expired license, will not make you ineligible for this process or create a presumption of ineligibility. Q. Are juvenile delinquency dispositions subject to the presumption of ineligibility? A. Yes. Juvenile delinquency dispositions will create a presumption of ineligibility for purposes of this process, even if they do not constitute convictions for immigration purposes. However, the factors considered when determining whether the presumption has been overcome, such as the nature of the underlying offense, your age at the time of the commission of the underlying offense, the length of time that has passed since the adjudication, and any other relevant facts surrounding the offense may be especially relevant in such cases. In addition, we may consider your entire criminal history, if any, along with other positive factors to determine, whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. If you cannot provide the record of the disposition because it is sealed or because State law prohibits its disclosure (even to you), USCIS still may request a statement or other information from you to determine whether the presumption has been overcome and a favorable exercise of discretion is otherwise warranted."

          "answer": "A. No. You cannot appeal the decision if we deny your parole in place request. However, you can file a new request, with new or additional evidence demonstrating your eligibility for parole in place, with the accompanying $580 filing fee. Q. Can I file a motion to reopen or reconsider USCIS denial of my request under Keeping Families Together? A. No. You cannot file a motion to reopen or reconsider the denial of your parole in place request under Keeping Families Together. However, you can file a new request, with new or additional evidence demonstrating your eligibility for parole in place, with the accompanying $580 filing fee. Q. What will I receive if USCIS approves my request under Keeping Families Together? A. If USCIS approves your parole in place request, you will receive a Form I-797, Approval Notice, that indicates the grant and validity period of parole in place. It will also include a copy of your Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, and Form I-94 number. Q. If my request for Keeping Families Together is approved, will I accrue unlawful presence? A. No. If you are granted parole in place under Keeping Families Together, you are in a period of authorized stay, which means you do not accrue unlawful presence while your parole remains valid (that is, not expired or terminated). Importantly, however, if you receive parole in place under Keeping Families Together, it does not erase any unlawful presence accruedbeforethe start of your parole period. Furthermore, a pending request for parole in place does not stop the accrual of unlawful presence. If your parole expires or is otherwise terminated, you will begin accruingunlawful presenceunless you are maintaining or obtain another status during the parole period. Parole may be terminated at any time in DHS’s discretion upon a determination that parole is no longer warranted, for example, following the commission of criminal conduct. It is recommended that you apply for lawful permanent resident status as soon as possible after obtaining parole in place under this process. For more information on applying for lawful permanent resident status, please visit theHow to Apply for a Green Cardwebpage. Q. If USCIS does not grant my request, will I be placed in removal proceedings? A. If we deny your request for parole in place, we will generally not issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) or refer your case to ICE for possible enforcement action solely based on the denial, unless DHS is initiating immigration enforcement proceedings against you because you are considered a priority under the Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF)as a threat to national security, public safety, or border security.* *NOTE:Consistent with these guidelines, an alien who poses a threat to border security will be generally disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this process. However, there is an exception for stepchildren who entered the United States unlawfully after Nov. 1, 2020, and who otherwise meet the criteria for parole in place under this process. Q. What happens if my request under Keeping Families Together is granted, but I do not apply for or receive adjustment of status during my parole period? A. When the parole period terminates, an alien returns to the same immigration status or category that they maintained before the parole in place, if any (unless that status or category has since expired or terminated), and their case will be dealt with in the same manner as any other applicant for admission, unless they obtained another immigration status or category during the parole period that is still valid beyond the parole end date. As stated above, DHS is not contemplating a re-parole process."

          "answer": "A. Yes, you may make a request for this process while you have a pending Form I-601A. If you are granted parole in place under this process, you may then be eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident by filing Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, in the United States without first seeking a provisional unlawful presence waiver. If your Form I-131F request is granted and you then apply for adjustment of status with USCIS, you will no longer be eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, and we will deny your Form I-601A. Q. What will happen with my pending Form I-601A if I file a request under Keeping Families Together? A. Your Form I-601A will remain pending and will be adjudicated in the normal course. We will not refund the fee you paid for Form I-601A if you file a request for parole in place under this process. In addition, note that if your parole in place is granted and you apply to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident (Form I-485), you will no longer be eligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, and we will deny your Form I-601A. Q. My Form I-601A was approved, but I have not left the United States to attend a consular interview yet. May I make a request under Keeping Families Together? A. Yes. If you are present in the United States without admission or parole, are otherwise eligible for this process, and merit a favorable exercise of discretion, we may approve your request even though we already approved your Form I-601A. Q. I previously filed a Form I-601A and now am filing a Form I-131F. Do I have to pay the Form I-131F fee? A. Yes. You must pay the $580 fee for the Form I-131F, even if you previously filed a Form I-601A. Q. I previously filed a Form I-601A. Will you prioritize consideration of my Form I-131F? A. USCIS may prioritize your Form I-131F if you have a pending or approved Form I-601A and you include your Form I-601A receipt number on your Form I-131F request. For this reason, you should make sure to include your Form I-601A receipt number on your Form I-131F. NOTE:For your case to be identified and potentially prioritized, you must ensure that all biographic information on Form I-131F, including your name, exactly match the information you provided on the Form I-601A you previously filed. Q. I have a pending Form I-601A. What happens to that request if my request under Keeping Families Together is granted? A. Your Form I-601A will remain pending and will be adjudicated in turn. However, one of the eligibility requirements for the Form I-601A is that you do not have a pending application for lawful permanent residence with USCIS. Therefore, if you are granted parole in place and file for adjustment of status with USCIS, your pending Form I-601A will be denied. Q. If I am granted parole in place under Keeping Families Together and no longer need a provisional unlawful presence waiver, will USCIS refund the filing fee for my Form I-601A? A. No. Keeping Families Together is voluntary and requires payment of the requisite fee even if you have filed a Form I-601A. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is denied, does this affect the decision on my pending Form I-601A? A. No. The denial of a request for parole in place does not affect the adjudication of the Form I-601A, but the reasons that led to the denial of a parole in place request may also affect eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, including the determination of whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion. Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is denied, can I still file a Form I-601A? A. Yes. Form I-601A has different eligibility requirements than parole in place. A denial of parole in place does not make you ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver; however, you should review the reasons for the denial of your parole in place request to determine if any of those reasons also make you ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver."

USCIS may prioritize your Form I-131F if you have a pending or approved Form I-601A and you include your Form I-601A receipt number on your Form I-131F request. For this reason, you should make sure to include your Form I-601A receipt number on your Form I-131F. NOTE:For your case to be identified and potentially prioritized, you must ensure that all biographic information on Form I-131F, including your name, exactly match the information you provided on the Form I-601A you previously filed. Q. I have a pending Form I-601A. What happens to that request if my request under Keeping Families Together is granted? A. Your Form I-601A will remain pending and will be adjudicated in turn. However, one of the eligibility requirements for the Form I-601A is that you do not have a pending application for lawful permanent residence with USCIS. Therefore, if you are granted parole in place and file for adjustment of status with USCIS, your pending Form I-601A will be denied. Q. If I am granted parole in place under Keeping Families Together and no longer need a provisional unlawful presence waiver, will USCIS refund the filing fee for my Form I-601A? A. No. Keeping Families Together is voluntary and requires payment of the requisite fee even if you have filed a Form I-601A. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is denied, does this affect the decision on my pending Form I-601A? A. No. The denial of a request for parole in place does not affect the adjudication of the Form I-601A, but the reasons that led to the denial of a parole in place request may also affect eligibility for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, including the determination of whether you merit a favorable exercise of discretion. Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is denied, can I still file a Form I-601A? A. Yes. Form I-601A has different eligibility requirements than parole in place. A denial of parole in place does not make you ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver; however, you should review the reasons for the denial of your parole in place request to determine if any of those reasons also make you ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver."

          "question": "Q. If my request for Keeping Families Together is granted, will I be eligible to request employment authorization?",
          "answer": "A. Yes. If USCIS approves your request for Keeping Families Together, you can apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) by filingForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, under eligibility category (c)(11). You can only apply for employment authorizationafteryour Keeping Families Together request is approved. If you file your Form I-765 Employment application before USCIS approves your I-131F request under this process, USCIS will reject or deny your Form I-765. Q. Will there be a fee to apply for employment authorization (Form I-765)? A. Yes. If you file online through your myUSCIS account, the filing fee for Form I-765 is $470. If you file on paper and send your application by mail, the filing fee forForm I-765is $520. Q. Can I request a fee waiver for my application for employment authorization after I am granted parole under the Keeping Families Together parole process? A. If you are requesting a fee waiver, you can do so using one of two options.You may mail in a paper version ofForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiver, or a written request for a fee waiver with supporting evidence of your financial inability to pay the fee with your Form I-765. For applicants using the (c)(11) category code on Form I-765, you may also file using the online PDF filing option in a USCIS online account. You may upload your completed Form I-912 with your completed Form I-765 using your USCIS online account. Please visit ourRequest for Fee Waiverwebpage for additional information, guidance and tips on fee waiver requests. You can also review theForm G-1055for a complete fee schedule. Q. Can I file my Form I-131F at the same time (concurrently) as an application for employment authorization (Form I-765)? A. No, at this time, you must submit these two forms separately. If your Form I-131F is approved and you are granted parole in place, you can then file Form I-765 to apply for an EAD based on your authorized period of parole. Q. How long will I be authorized for employment? A. If your request for this process is approved and you are later granted an employment authorization document (EAD) under eligibility category (c)(11), your EAD will generally be valid for the same duration as your parole period, which can be up to three years under this process. Once you apply for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident, you will then be eligible to apply for employment authorization pending adjudicating of your adjustment application under eligibility category (c)(9). You can receive employment authorization with a five-year validity under category (c)(9). If your parole under this process is granted, you should not delay in filing a subsequent I-130 petition and I-485 application. Q. What should I do if my Employment Authorization Document (EAD) was lost, stolen, or damaged? A. If your parole period is currently valid, and you need to replace a valid EAD because yours was lost, stolen, or damaged, please review the “Replace an EAD” section on theEmployment Authorization Documentpage. NOTE: Do notfile Form I-131F with this replacement Form I-765. If you submit Form I-131F when you are filing to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged EAD, we will deny your Form I-I31F, and we will not refund the filing fee for Form I-131F. Q. As an employer, if I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for parole in place, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company? A. An employer may, as they determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting parole in place under this process with documentation verifying their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment of aliens), except in cases involving unscrupulous employers who exploit alien workers by engaging in illegal acts ranging from the payment of substandard wages to imposing unsafe working conditions and facilitating human trafficking and child exploitation, and who therefore may be a DHS worksite enforcement priority as described in the Oct. 12, 2021 memorandum entitled “Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual.” Q. How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a parolee? A. An employer may be engaging in discrimination if they: Demand that an employee only show specific documents from theLists of Acceptable Documentsor ask for more or different documents than are required to completeForm I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, or create anE-Verify case; orReject documents from theLists of Acceptable Documentsthat reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, including documentation showing employment authorization because it has a future expiration date or because of an employee’s prior unauthorized status. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not discriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the United States. These include parolees who have been granted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at 800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: 800-237-2515). Q. What happens to my employment authorization if USCIS terminates my parole before it expires? A. If USCIS terminates your grant of parole, there will no longer be a basis for your parole-based employment authorization. USCIS may therefore revoke your employment authorization."

You can receive employment authorization with a five-year validity under category (c)(9). If your parole under this process is granted, you should not delay in filing a subsequent I-130 petition and I-485 application. Q. What should I do if my Employment Authorization Document (EAD) was lost, stolen, or damaged? A. If your parole period is currently valid, and you need to replace a valid EAD because yours was lost, stolen, or damaged, please review the “Replace an EAD” section on theEmployment Authorization Documentpage. NOTE: Do notfile Form I-131F with this replacement Form I-765. If you submit Form I-131F when you are filing to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged EAD, we will deny your Form I-I31F, and we will not refund the filing fee for Form I-131F. Q. As an employer, if I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for parole in place, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company? A. An employer may, as they determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting parole in place under this process with documentation verifying their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment of aliens), except in cases involving unscrupulous employers who exploit alien workers by engaging in illegal acts ranging from the payment of substandard wages to imposing unsafe working conditions and facilitating human trafficking and child exploitation, and who therefore may be a DHS worksite enforcement priority as described in the Oct. 12, 2021 memorandum entitled “Worksite Enforcement: The Strategy to Protect the American Labor Market, the Conditions of the American Worksite, and the Dignity of the Individual.” Q. How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a parolee? A. An employer may be engaging in discrimination if they: Demand that an employee only show specific documents from theLists of Acceptable Documentsor ask for more or different documents than are required to completeForm I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, or create anE-Verify case; orReject documents from theLists of Acceptable Documentsthat reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, including documentation showing employment authorization because it has a future expiration date or because of an employee’s prior unauthorized status. The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not discriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the United States. These include parolees who have been granted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at 800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: 800-237-2515). Q. What happens to my employment authorization if USCIS terminates my parole before it expires? A. If USCIS terminates your grant of parole, there will no longer be a basis for your parole-based employment authorization. USCIS may therefore revoke your employment authorization."

If USCIS grants my request under Keeping Families Together, does this mean I will be eligible to adjust my status to that of a lawful permanent resident (LPR)? A. This process does not change the eligibility criteria for LPR status but provides an opportunity for eligible alien spouses and children of U.S. citizens to adjust their status under existing legal authorities without having to depart the United States to seek an immigrant visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate. To qualify for adjustment of status underINA 245(a), an applicant must prove that they have been inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States, among other requirements. A grant of parole in place will satisfy the parole requirement under INA 245(a). Eligibility forForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, and any related forms that might be required, includingForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, will be determined on their own merits in a distinct and separate process from the parole in place decision. Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is granted, am I subject to the “3- and 10-year unlawful presence bars” and the “permanent bar”? A.

For more information about how unlawful presence impacts the determination of inadmissibility, please visitUnlawful Presence and Inadmissibility. Determining if you are inadmissible after accruing unlawful presence can be complex. If you need help or legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice. You can find information about authorized legal services on ourAvoid Scamspage. Q. If I have previously worked in the United States without employment authorization, am I ineligible for adjustment of status under INA section 245(c)(2) and 245(c)(8)? A. The bars to adjustment of status at INA section 245(c)(2) and INA section 245(c)(8), which are related to accepting or engaging in unauthorized employment, generally do not apply to aliens seeking adjustment of status based on an approved Form I-130 as an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen. Spouses and children of U.S. citizens are considered immediate relatives under the INA. Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is granted, what will happen to me if my spouse passes away before I am able to apply to adjust my status (before my parole period ends)? A. If your U.S. citizen spouse has died, you may still be eligible foradjustment of statusif you meet the eligibility requirements. To qualify, you must not have been legally separated from your spouse at the time of death and you must not remarry before USCIS adjudicates your adjustment application.

Generally, you will be ineligible to adjust status as the spouse of a U.S. citizen if you and your spouse divorce before you apply to adjust status. To be eligible for immigrant petition approval or to adjust status as the spouse of a U.S. citizen, you must still be married to your spouse at the time of application and final adjudication. Q. If my request under Keeping Families Together is granted, will I be subject to the public charge ground of inadmissibility when I apply to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident? A. If you apply for adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident after you are granted parole under this process, you must demonstrate that you are not inadmissible under the public charge ground of inadmissibility at INA 212(a)(4) (unless you are exempt from the public charge ground of inadmissibility), as well as the other grounds of inadmissibility in INA section 212.

CAUTION:Travel outside of the United States, even with advance parole, may have severe immigration-related consequences, including with respect to potential inadmissibility or execution of an outstanding order of removal. Parole into the United States is not guaranteed even if you have been granted advance parole prior to leaving the country. You are still subject to immigration inspection at a U.S. port of entry to determine whether you may be paroled into the United States and whether you are eligible for the immigration status you seek. For further information, seeTravel Documents | USCIS. Consultation with a qualified attorney or accredited representative is strongly advised prior to any travel outside of the United States."
