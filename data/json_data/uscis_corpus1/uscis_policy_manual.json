Background and Interpretation Change\nApplicants for and recipients of immigration relief under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA)\n[1]\nand the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000\n[2]\nare entitled to special protections with regard to privacy and confidentiality and adverse determinations of inadmissibility and deportability.\n[3]\nThe governing statute prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of information about requestors and recipients of VAWA, T nonimmigrant, and U nonimmigrant-related benefit requests to anyone other than an officer or employee of DHS, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the U.S. Department of State who has a need to know.\n[4]\nUSCIS also extends the provisions of 8 U.S.C. 1367 to abused spouses of certain persons applying for employment authorization under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n[5]\nUnder prior practice, USCIS applied the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections indefinitely. This has meant that USCIS maintained these protections even after naturalization.\nThese protections offer important safeguards: an unauthorized disclosure of information that relates to a protected person can have significant consequences. However, the protections under 8 U.S.C. 1367 can pose barriers to accessing USCIS customer service tools and electronic benefit processing after naturalization because of identity verification requirements.\n[6]\n8 U.S.C. 1367 was designed to “ensure that abusers and criminals cannot use the immigration system against their victims,” such as by obtaining information about the existence of immigration benefit requests, “interfering with or undermining their victims’ immigration cases,” or “encouraging immigration enforcement officers to pursue removal actions against their victims.”\n[7]\nAfter naturalization, the concerns underlying the creation of 8 U.S.C. 1367 become less relevant and necessary as a safety mechanism: naturalized citizens are no longer subject to removal and can travel and work without seeking permission from USCIS. However, because USCIS continued to apply the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections after naturalization, naturalized citizens who needed to interface with USCIS continued to face limitations in accessing USCIS’ telephonic and electronic customer service tools.\n8 U.S.C. 1367 protects “any information which relates to an alien who is the beneficiary of an application for relief under paragraph (15)(T), (15)(U), or (51) of section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T), (U), (51)] or section 240A(b)(2) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(2)].”\n[8]\n“Alien” is defined at INA 101(a)(3) as “any person not a citizen or national of the United States.”\nUpon naturalization, persons protected by 8 U.S.C. 1367 become citizens and are no longer aliens; therefore, the use of the term “alien” at 8 U.S.C. 1367 authorizes USCIS to terminate these protections at naturalization. In addition, the regulations at 8 CFR 214.14(e)(1) (relating to disclosure protections for U nonimmigrants) and 8 CFR 211.1(p)(1) (relating to T nonimmigrants) apply protections to a “beneficiary of a pending or approved petition for U [or T] nonimmigrant status,” which can reasonably be understood to refer to beneficiaries up to, but not including, naturalized citizens.\nBy interpreting the protections under 8 U.S.C. 1367 to terminate at naturalization, USCIS continues to comply with the statutory confidentiality protections for aliens but reduces the burden and inefficiencies for naturalized citizens.\nB. Administrative Procedure Act Considerations\nThe Administrative Procedure Act excepts interpretive rules; general statements of policy; and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice and comment requirements.\n[9]\nOn June 12, 2024, USCIS updated the Policy Manual to notify the public of its interpretation of “alien who is the beneficiary of an application for relief under paragraph (15)(T), (15)(U), or (51) of section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T), (U), (51)] or section 240A(b)(2) of such Act [8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)(2)]” at 8 U.S.C. 1367 and explain that it is changing its policy to no longer apply the protections under that section to all previously protected naturalized citizens, including those who naturalized prior to the effective date of this policy, as a result of this interpretation.\n[10]\nUSCIS’ interpretation is reasonable because “alien” is defined at INA 101(a)(3) as “any person not a citizen or national of the United States.” USCIS interprets the protections at 8 U.S.C. 1367 to terminate upon naturalization because the formerly protected persons are no longer aliens, as defined by statute. This interpretation is based on the plain language of 8 U.S.C. 1367 and INA 101(a)(3) and is consistent with the legislative intent of 8 U.S.C. 1367.\n[11]\nThe Policy Manual guidance explains and provides clarification to officers but does not add to or subtract from the statutory protections or the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights or obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS evaluates applications for immigration benefit requests.\nUnfair Surprise and Reliance Interest\nChanges in an agency’s interpretation of a statute do not trigger notice and comment rulemaking unless the change amounts to an imposition of new rights, duties, or obligations on the affected public, or the change conflicts with another rule having the force of law.\n[12]\nLikewise, an agency can change its interpretation of a regulation at different times in its history as long as the interpretative changes create no unfair surprise.\n[13]\nHere, USCIS is reducing the barriers to the affected public after having received consistent feedback from stakeholders who have been unable to get meaningful customer service assistance because of protections lingering beyond naturalization. This interpretive change promotes equitable and efficient processing for all naturalized citizens, regardless of whether they were previously subject to 8 U.S.C. 1367.\nUSCIS recognizes that this is a change in long-standing practice and accordingly considered serious reliance interests that may be engendered by the practices of USCIS officers before this interpretation. USCIS also considered the possible unfair surprise for those previously protected naturalized citizens.\nUSCIS acknowledges that persons protected by 8 U.S.C. 1367 had protections continuing after naturalization that prohibited sharing any information about them unless certain requirements were met. However, USCIS ultimately determined that termination of the additional stringent requirements of protecting confidentiality does not place naturalized citizens at greater risk. The standard protocols the agency has in place to protect all information from unauthorized disclosure, in addition to the relevant privacy laws, remain in effect. USCIS does not release personal identifying information without an authorized purpose and proper verification.\nAdditionally, USCIS maintains the ability to re-apply the protections, should questions arise regarding citizenship eligibility. Further, a naturalized U.S. citizen’s derivative beneficiaries remain protected by statute until the individual beneficiary becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nUSCIS believes the overall benefits of this interpretive change outweigh any potential adverse impacts and are aligned with the plain language of the statute. Naturalized citizens will be able to utilize USCIS’ customer service and electronic benefits processing tools more effectively and will remain protected from unauthorized disclosures of personal identifying information under existing privacy laws.\nImplementation\nUSCIS delayed implementation of this policy until 30 days after publication. Upon implementation, USCIS stopped applying the 8 U.S.C. 1367 protections to all naturalized citizens, including those who previously naturalized and those who naturalize on or after the effective date of this policy. Interested parties may provide feedback on the policy, as is generally provided for Policy Manual publications.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nSee\nPub.

Background\nAn alien granted U-1 nonimmigrant status as a principal petitioner is employment authorized incident to status. USCIS automatically issues an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to principal petitioners upon the approval of the U nonimmigrant status petition.\n[1]\nThe statute only allows 10,000 U nonimmigrant visas to be issued every fiscal year.\n[2]\nIf the number of approvable petitions exceeds 10,000, USCIS places the approvable petitions on a waiting list. Once they are on the waiting list, USCIS grants deferred action or, in limited circumstances, parole to U-1 principal petitioners and qualifying family members and, as a matter of discretion, may authorize employment for such petitioners and qualifying family members.\n[3]\nUSCIS generally provides such employment authorization under\n8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14)\n. Under the existing regulatory structure, aliens with pending petitions are currently unable to apply for employment authorization before waiting list placement.\nThe William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA 2008), signed into law on December 23, 2008, amended Section 214(p)(6) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to provide DHS with discretion to grant employment authorization to an alien who has a pending, bona fide petition for U nonimmigrant status.\n[4]\nThough permitted by statute, DHS had not previously implemented a process for providing such employment authorization, separate from the existing regulatory waiting list, before June 14, 2021.\nThe permissive language of\nINA 214(p)(6)\ndoes not require the agency to create a separate employment authorization process. However, because of drastic increases in the volume of U nonimmigrant petitions and a growing backlog, USCIS decided to exercise its discretion to conduct bona fide determinations (BFD) and provide EADs and deferred action to aliens with pending, bona fide petitions who meet certain discretionary standards, beginning on June 14, 2021.\nINA 103(a)\ngrants the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority to enforce the immigration laws and provides general authority for deferred action. The U.S. Supreme Court has clarified that decisions made to either initiate or terminate enforcement proceedings are under the purview of the Executive Branch,\n[5]\nand therefore fall within DHS’s authority. The Executive Branch has exercised its discretion to grant deferred action, and the federal courts have consistently recognized the existence of this authority, since the mid-1970s.\n[6]\nWhile USCIS has approved the statutory maximum of petitions each year since Fiscal Year 2010, the increasing number of petitions and complexity of the adjudication resulted in increased processing times. USCIS attempted to keep up with this increase by shifting resources as well as hiring and training new officers; yet, despite these attempts, the burden quickly outpaced resources given competing demands and priorities across the agency.\nConsequently, the number of remaining pending petitions after the annual cap was reached grew dramatically. Though the waiting list was initially conceived to address the gap between petitions filed and available visas, USCIS’ ability to adjudicate pending petitions for placement on the waiting list has been and continues to be outmatched by the steady number of new filings.\nTo illustrate, in 2009, USCIS received 6,850 principal petitions; in 2020, 22,358 principal petitions were filed. From 2015-2018, over 30,000 principal petitions were filed annually.\n[7]\nThe pending backlog, and the corresponding delay in adjudication time, is due to the increase in U visa filings overall, the complexity of the adjudication, the statutory cap mandated by Congress, and the agency’s priorities and limited resources.\nAs of June 14, 2021, USCIS is unable to adjudicate the tens of thousands of petitions for the waiting list, as well as completing full adjudication for the 10,000 principal visas available under the statutory cap, in a single fiscal year without incurring a negative impact in other humanitarian programs and fee-based applications or petitions.\nTaking into consideration the overall filings increase and the numerous adjudications USCIS is responsible for, USCIS must allocate resources among the competing adjudicative priorities and balance the number of resources that can be assigned to the U visa program.\nAdditionally, as of June 14, 2021, USCIS is facing substantial litigation fueled by the years-long wait times for petitioners to be placed on the waiting list and obtain U nonimmigrant status due to the number of new petitions filed each year exceeding the statutory cap. Case review has revealed that most U nonimmigrant petitioners do not have lawful immigration status and are not otherwise authorized to work, so they may be vulnerable during the lengthy adjudication period.\nUSCIS recognizes concerns regarding such vulnerability raised by stakeholders and believes implementing the statute’s authorization to provide EADs to those with pending, bona fide petitions better aligns the U program with its dual purpose as envisioned by Congress: stabilizing victims of crime and serving as a tool for law enforcement.\n[8]\nIn addition, the BFD process enables USCIS to review petitions more efficiently, and provide the benefits of employment authorization and deferred action to more petitioners in a shorter time period than the waiting list process alone, which requires a full adjudicative review of eligibility for nonimmigrant status. USCIS notes that from FY 2009 through FY 2020, over 75 percent of fully adjudicated Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (\nForm I-918\n) have been approved.\n[9]\nTherefore, under this policy, USCIS deems a petition “bona fide” when USCIS determines that the Form I-918 is complete and properly filed\n[10]\nand has received the result of the petitioner’s biometrics. Because INA 214(p)(6) gives the Secretary of Homeland Security, and USCIS as the Secretary's designee, discretion to issue employment authorization to pending, bona fide principal petitioners and qualifying family members, USCIS also considers whether the principal petitioners or qualifying family members appear to pose a risk to national security\n[11]\nor public safety, and otherwise merit a favorable exercise of discretion.\nThe EAD and deferred action that USCIS issues for these cases is valid for 4 years, subject to termination if USCIS determines a national security or public safety concern has arisen, or a determination that the BFD EAD is no longer warranted, or that the prior BFD EAD and deferred action was issued in error.\nUSCIS issues BFD EADs under\n8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14)\nbecause recipients of BFD EADs also receive deferred action. Furthermore, there is currently no other EAD category specifically designated for principal petitioners and qualifying family members with pending, bona fide petitions. INA 214(p)(6) provides the statutory foundation for the implementation of the BFD process, and explicitly speaks to the granting of employment authorization. As such, petitioners granted BFD EADs receive employment authorization documents under\n8 CFR 274a.12(c)(14)\n.\nB. Administrative Procedure Act Considerations\nThe Administrative Procedure Act (APA) excepts interpretive rules; general statements of policy; and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice from notice and comment requirements.\n[12]\nOn June 14, 2021, USCIS updated the Policy Manual to notify the public of its interpretation of “bona fide application” at\nINA 214(p)(6)\n, its exercise of discretion under that provision, and explain its policy for issuing such EADs and granting deferred action. USCIS’ interpretation is reasonable because “bona fide” generally means “made in good faith; without fraud or deceit.”\n[13]\nIn this context,  USCIS interprets the bona fide standard\n[14]\nas being met once the entire petition (including the required certification on\nForm I-918, Supplement B\n) is properly filed and biometrics are submitted and received. The completion of the Supplement B by a law enforcement official or judge provides an appropriate assurance of the bona fide nature of the petition in this context.\nLikewise, because INA 214(p)(6) gives USCIS discretionary authority to issue such employment authorization, it is reasonable, in the exercise of such discretion,  to assess security checks to determine whether petitioners may pose a threat to national security or public safety before according benefits under this section.\nThe Policy Manual guidance explains and provides clarification to officers but does not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights or obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS evaluates applications for immigration benefit requests.\n1. Unfair Surprise and Reliance Interests\nAn agency changing its interpretation of a regulation should consider, among other factors, whether the interpretative change creates unfair surprise.\n[15]\nUSCIS is issuing this guidance to clarify what the law and regulations permit or require. USCIS is not restricting the program for pending petitioners; rather, USCIS is using its statutory authority to provide an additional pathway to employment authorization and deferred action. Pending petitioners will not be treated in a disparate or unfair manner, as the evaluation for an EAD is based on the initial evidence petitioners must submit when filing a Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (\nForm I-918\n).\nThis process does not create an undue burden on pending or future petitioners, as it does not change any evidentiary requirement. Rather, it utilizes the filing system already in place to issue benefits to Form I-918 petitioners and mitigate any vulnerabilities they may face due to the lengthy adjudicatory wait times.\nAdditionally, those who are not granted BFD EADs and deferred action under the first phase of review proceed to the full waiting list adjudication, thereby receiving the same adjudicative review they would have had before this policy implementation. Consequently, the new policy only has an adverse impact on overseas derivatives where the principal petitioner resides in the U.S.\nUSCIS notes that overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members would not benefit from this EAD and deferred action process because they are not physically located in the United States. Neither deferred action nor employment authorization are accorded to aliens or qualifying family members outside the United States.\nUSCIS considered the potential impact to such petitioners and determined that offering employment authorization and deferred action to the majority of petitioners (as a majority of Form I-918 petitioners are physically located in the United States), coupled with the statutory authority to provide employment to pending, bona fide petitioners, provides numerous benefits.\nAdditionally, USCIS does not anticipate that overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members would be harmed by this process, since the agency continues to conduct full waiting list adjudications for overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members, as the agency has previously done. Consequently, this policy has no adverse impact upon overseas principal petitioners and qualifying family members.\nUSCIS notes that there will be adverse impacts to overseas qualifying family members where the principal petitioner is in the United States; if the principal petitioner receives the BFD EAD and deferred action, there is not a sufficient basis to conduct a waiting list adjudication for the qualifying family member.\nHowever, USCIS believes the overall benefits of this policy change outweigh the adverse impacts. The BFD process only provides a basic review of the principal petition for U nonimmigrant status, and does not require the petitioner to establish eligibility for U nonimmigrant status but for visa availability in a given fiscal year under the statutory cap.\nUSCIS cannot provide different levels of adjudication to a principal petitioner and the petitioner's qualifying family members. Advancing qualifying family members to an adjudicative phase beyond that of the principal petitioner would conflict with the INA’s requirement that the qualifying family members be “accompanying or following to join” the principal petitioner, and in addition would be confusing and difficult to administer.\n[16]\nUSCIS also considered providing petitioners in the United States who have overseas beneficiaries the option of forgoing the BFD process for a waiting list adjudication; however, this would create multiple adjudicatory tracks and result in operational inefficiencies that this policy change was meant to eliminate.\nUSCIS recognizes that\n8 CFR 214.14(d)(2)\nstates, “After U-1 nonimmigrant status has been issued to qualifying petitioners on the waiting list, any remaining U-1 nonimmigrant numbers for that fiscal year will be issued to new qualifying petitioners in the order that the petitions were properly filed.” Historically, USCIS has interpreted and applied this provision to mean that it will grant visas to those on the waiting list, based on the date the petition was filed, before granting visas to those not on the waiting list. Yet the regulation also clearly states “the oldest petitions receiving the highest priority” for such cap numbers.\nUnder this policy, as part of the first phase of review, USCIS issues EADs and deferred action to aliens in the United States with a bona fide petition, instead of placing them in the queue for a waiting list adjudication. Those who do not receive an EAD under the first phase proceed to the full waiting list adjudication.\nThat is, if their petitions are approvable, they are placed on the waiting list to receive an EAD and deferred action. As these two tracks receive the same benefits (EAD and deferred action), the most equitable path is to continue to issue visas based on the date a petition is filed, regardless of whether a petitioner is placed on the waiting list or not. USCIS believes this approach best implements the regulatory provision and statute, and provides the greatest benefit to all petitioners, without adversely impacting any petitioner.\nUSCIS considered the alternative of continuing to adjudicate petitions on the waiting list first, before those with BFD EADs, but believes that would be inequitable and in conflict with the regulatory language directing that the oldest petitions receive the highest priority. Most of those with BFD EADs will never be placed on the waiting list.\nTo make them wait behind all petitioners on the current waiting list regardless of filing date, and to prioritize those placed on the waiting list in the future, would effectively penalize those who were able to receive BFD EADs because they had properly filed a complete Form I-918 that did not raise any public safety or national security risks. Accordingly, USCIS will adjudicate petitions for U nonimmigrant status in date-filed order, drawing from both BFD EAD recipients and petitioners on the waiting list.\n2. Criminal History Check for Bona Fide Determination Employment Authorization Documents\nBefore June 14, 2021, USCIS officers considered criminal history background checks when adjudicating a Form I-918 petition: first, for waiting list placement and second, for the final adjudication when a visa has become available.\nUSCIS continues to evaluate whether a principal petitioner or a qualifying family member may maintain a BFD EAD and grant of deferred action throughout the 4-year validity period until final adjudication for U nonimmigrant status; however, as of June 14, 2021, USCIS will review and update background and security checks at regular intervals during the validity period of a principal petitioner or qualifying family member’s BFD EAD and deferred action. USCIS also retains discretion to update background and security checks at any time when case-specific circumstances warrant.\nBy reviewing updated background and security checks at regular intervals during the validity period, USCIS will ensure the petitioner continues to pose no risk to public safety and national security. USCIS does not believe this review would adversely impact any petitioner’s reliance interests or raise retroactivity concerns, as the checks are already run regularly.\nAdditionally, implementing these checks allows USCIS to maintain a balance between providing employment authorization to eligible immigrant victims of crime and ensuring the security of the United States. Finally, any public safety and national security issues raised anew after a BFD EAD and deferred action have been granted will be fully evaluated during the waiting list adjudication, under the same adjudicative review as would have occurred before this policy implementation.\nC. Implementation\nUSCIS began implementing this policy on June 14, 2021. This policy applies to all Form I-918 petitions pending on June 14, 2021, as well as Form I-918 petitions filed on or after that date. The guidance contained in the Policy Manual is controlling and supersedes any related prior guidance.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nSee\n8 CFR 214.14(c)(7)\n.

One of the main purposes for issuing employment authorization to those with pending, bona fide petitions is to provide EADs to good faith petitioners who are vulnerable due to lengthy wait times. Requiring and adjudicating the Form I-192 for purposes of the EAD would delay the EAD adjudication and undermine the efficiency goals of this change. Instead of adjudicating the Form I-192 at this stage, USCIS relies on criminal history checks.\n[^ 11]\nSee\nINA 212(a)(3)\n.\n[^ 12]\nSee\n5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A)\n.\n[^ 13]\nSee Black’s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019).\n[^ 14]\nUSCIS considered different potential definitions of “bona fide” and ultimately determined that this definition was best suited to this context. USCIS specifically considered the criteria for the “bona fide determination” at 8 CFR 214.11(e), regarding alien victims of severe forms of trafficking, but ultimately decided not to adopt those criteria because of the differences between the U and T visa requirements, such as the law enforcement certification requirement for U nonimmigrant petitioners. See\nINA 214(p)(1)\n;\n8 CFR 214.14(c)(2)(i)\n. The completion of the Supplement B by a law enforcement official or judge provides an appropriate assurance of the bona fide nature of the petition in this context. Additionally, the T regulation requires consideration of waivers of inadmissibility, for which an RFE is often required. This would significantly delay the U BFD adjudication, contrary to Congress’ likely intent in authorizing the issuance of this interim benefit. It would also undermine the procedural efficiencies this policy was intended to create in comparison with the waiting list process.\n[^ 15]\nSee\nLong Island Care at Home Ltd. v.

Calimlim\n, 538 F.3d 706, 713 (7th Cir. 2008) (finding that the employer’s actions of keeping victim’s passport, never admitting they were violating law, or offering to try and regularize the worker’s presence in the United States and implicit threats that she may be subject to deportation proceedings constituted “abuse of law”).\nUnited States v.

Farrell\n, 563 F.3d 364, 372-73 (8th Cir. 2009) (The workers’ relationship with their employers was more akin to one of debt bondage rather than simple debt. Given the continually mounting expenses, at no point was the value of the workers' labor sufficient to liquidate the debt and there was, in effect, no limit to the length of the services required to satisfy the obligation or even a limit on the amount owed.).\nCompensation for labor:\nUnited States v.

Marcus                           (PDF)\n, 487 F.Supp.2d 289 (E.D.N.Y. 2007), vacated on other grounds, 538 F.3d 97 (2d Cir. 2008) (Enslavement can arise even if the initial participation in the labor was part of a consensual alternative sexual relationship.).\nDuration of victimization:\nUnited States v.

(“Section 1584 requires that involuntary servitude be for ‘any term,’ which suggests that the temporal duration can be slight.”).\nUnited States v.

And that involuntary portion would suffice to sustain the conviction.”).\nUnited States v. Dann                           (PDF)\n, 652 F.3d 1160, 1167 (9th Cir. 2001) (The charge of forced labor need not apply to the entire duration of the victim’s services or labor.

However, they may have obtained citizenship under a different law if their adoptive parent(s) were or became U.S. citizens. The law under which an adopted child may have obtained citizenship is the law that was in effect\n[1]\nwhile the adopted child was under the age of 18.\n[2]\nAdditionally, adoptees who did not obtain citizenship through their adoptive parents may obtain citizenship under a different law.\n[3]\nCitizenship and Naturalization Laws (Before October 5, 1978)\nBefore October 5, 1978, there were no statutory provisions that provided for the automatic acquisition of citizenship by adopted children through their adoptive parents (unless the child was adopted by their biological father and the adoption legitimated the child). An adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship if the adoptive parents applied for naturalization on the adopted child’s behalf. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 323), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18.\nCitizenship and Naturalization Laws (October 5, 1978 - February 27, 2001)\n[4]\nAdoptive Parents Were U.S. Citizens at Time of Adoption\nIf the adoptive parents were both U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, there was no path for an adopted child to automatically derive citizenship through them.\nThe adopted child may, however, have obtained citizenship through the child’s U.S. citizen adoptive parent(s), if the adoptive parent(s) applied for a Certificate of Naturalization or a Certificate of Citizenship on the adopted child’s behalf (under former INA 322). The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 322), had their application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18 (unless waived).\nAdoptive Parent(s) Naturalized After Adoption\nIf the adoptive parents were not U.S. citizens at the time of the adoption, or one parent was a U.S. citizen and one was not, and the alien parent(s) later became naturalized U.S. citizens before the adopted child turned 18, the adopted child may have automatically derived citizenship. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law (former INA 320 or 321). If the adopted child automatically derived citizenship under former INA 320 or 321, they may file  Application for Certificate of Citizenship (\nForm N-600\n), to seek documentation of their citizenship, or they may apply for a U.S. passport with the Department of State to serve as evidence of their U.S. citizenship.\nThe following table provides an overview of how previous provisions for automatic derivation of citizenship apply to adopted children.\nPrevious Derivation of Citizenship Provisions Applicability to Adopted Children\nPeriod in which the Last Action Took Place\n[5]\nCitizenship Status of Adoptive Parent(s)\nDerivation of Citizenship for Adopted Children\n[6]\nBefore Dec. 24, 1952\nN/A\nAdopted children cannot derive U.S. citizenship.\nOn or After\nDec. 24, 1952\nand Before\nOct. 5, 1978\nN/A\nAdopted children cannot derive U.S. citizenship, unless adopted by their biological father and adoption legitimates the child.\nHowever, adoptive parent(s) could apply for naturalization on behalf of certain adopted children.\n[7]\nOn or After\nOct. 5, 1978\nand Before\nFeb. 27, 2001\nAdoptive parent(s) were U.S. citizens at time of adoption\nIf the adoptive parent(s) were both U.S. citizens at the time of the child’s adoption, there was no path for the adoptee to derive citizenship through the adoptive parent(s).\nHowever, adoptive parent(s) could apply for naturalization on behalf of certain adopted children.\n[8]\nTo obtain citizenship based on an adoptive relationship, the child must have been adopted by a certain age depending on the period of last action.\n[9]\nOn or After\nOct. 5, 1978\nand Before\nFeb. 27, 2001\nNote:\nTo obtain citizenship based on an adoptive relationship, the child must have been adopted by a certain age depending on the period of last action.\n[10]\nAdoptive parent(s) naturalized after adoption\nThe child derived U.S. citizenship if the child was lawfully admitted as a permanent resident, was in the custody of the adoptive parents, and was residing in the United States at the time of naturalization of the adoptive parent(s), as described below:\n[11]\nOne adoptive parent naturalized before the child turned 18 years old and the other parent was already a U.S. citizen on the date the child was born and never lost that citizenship;\nThe surviving adoptive parent naturalized before the child turned 18 years old and the other died before the child turned 18;\nThe adoptive parent having legal custody of the child, where there was a divorce or legal separation of the parents, naturalized before the child turned 18 years old; or\nBoth adoptive parents naturalized before the child’s 18th birthday.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nThis is generally former INA 320 or former INA 321. The adopted child must have also met requirements applicable to adopted children under U.S. immigration laws that were in effect during the time period.\n[^ 2]\nFor adoptees who need more information about determining their immigration status, see the\nAdult Adoptees and U.S. Citizenship\nwebpage.\n[^ 3]\nFor information on the different paths to citizenship, see Volume 12, Citizenship and Naturalization [\n12 USCIS-PM\n].\n[^ 4]\nSee the Act of October 5, 1978,\nPub.

See former INA 321.\n[^ 5]\nFor example, the child’s admission as a lawful permanent resident or the finalization of the child’s adoption as the final criteria for eligibility took place during the described time period.\n[^ 6]\nSome adopted children who did not derive citizenship through their adoptive parent(s) may have obtained citizenship if the law at the time allowed their adoptive parent(s) to apply for citizenship or naturalization on their behalf, and their parents did so. The adopted child must have met the requirements under the applicable law, had the application approved, and taken the Oath of Allegiance before reaching the age of 18 (unless waived). Adoptees whose parents did not apply for citizenship or naturalization on their behalf may apply for naturalization when eligible.

From December 29, 1981, until February 26, 2001, the adoption must have taken place before the child turned 18 years of age. Note that the child must have also met age-related requirements to immigrate based on adoption under\nINA 101(b)(1)\n, which differ from age-related requirements for citizenship based on adoption. Under\nINA 101(b)(1)(E)\n, a child must be under age 16 at time of adoption, unless a sibling exception applies. See Part E, Family-Based Adoption Petitions, Chapter 2, Eligibility\n[5 USCIS-PM E.2\n].

For current USCIS policy on regional centers, see Chapter 4, Regional Center Applications [\n6 USCIS-PM G.4\n], Chapter 5, Project Applications [\n6 USCIS-PM G.5\n], and Chapter 6, Direct and Third Party Promoters [\n6 USCIS-PM G.6\n].\nThe goal of the Regional Center Program is to stimulate economic growth in a specified geographic area. The regional center model can offer an immigrant investor already defined investment opportunities, thereby reducing the immigrant investor’s responsibility to identify acceptable investment vehicles. If the new commercial enterprise is located within the geographic area, and falls within the economic scope of the defined regional center, reasonable methodologies can be used to demonstrate indirect job creation.\n[1]\nA regional center can be associated with one or more new commercial enterprises.\nA regional center seeking to participate in the Regional Center Program must submit a proposal using the Application For Regional Center Under the Immigrant Investor Program (Form I-924).\nUSCIS may designate a regional center based on a general proposal for the promotion of economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment. The statute further provides that a regional center shall have jurisdiction over a limited geographic area, which shall be described in the proposal and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones.\nIn addition, the establishment of a regional center may be based on general predictions, contained in the proposal, concerning the kinds of commercial enterprises that will receive capital from immigrant investors, the jobs that will be created directly or indirectly as a result of such capital investments, and the other positive economic effects such capital investments will have on the area.\n[2]\nThe regulations state that the proposal must:\nClearly describe how the regional center focuses on a geographical region of the United States and how it will promote economic growth through increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment;\nProvide in verifiable detail how jobs will be created directly or indirectly;\nProvide a detailed statement regarding the amounts and sources of capital which have been already committed to the regional center;\nProvide a description of the promotional efforts taken and planned by the sponsors of the regional center;\nInclude a detailed prediction\n[3]\nhow the regional center will have a positive impact on the regional or national economy based on factors such as increased household earnings, greater demand for business services, utilities, maintenance and repair, and construction both within and without the regional center; and\nBe supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools, including, but not limited to, feasibility studies, analyses of foreign and domestic markets for the goods or services to be exported, or multiplier tables.\n[4]\nThe level of verifiable detail required for a Form I-924 to be approved and provided deference may vary depending on the nature of the application filing.\n[5]\nA. Regional Center Application Proposals\nThe regional center proposal must include a management and operational plan to administer, oversee, and manage the proposed regional center, including but not limited to how the regional center:\nWill be promoted to attract immigrant investors, including a description of the budget for promotional activities;\nWill identify, assess, and evaluate proposed immigrant investor projects and enterprises;\nCharacterizes the structure of the investment capital it will sponsor; for example, whether the investment capital to be sought for job-creating companies will consist solely of immigrant investor capital or a combination of immigrant investor capital and domestic capital, and how the distribution of the investment capital will be structured (for example, loans to developers or venture capital); and\nWill oversee all investment activities affiliated with, through, or under the sponsorship of the proposed regional center.\nGeographic Area\nAn officer reviews the proposed geographic boundaries of a new regional center to determine if they are acceptable. USCIS considers geographic boundaries acceptable if the regional center applicant can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed area.\n[6]\nThe determination is fact-specific, and the law does not require any particular form of evidence, such as a county-by-county analysis.\nIn addition, a regional center’s geographic area must be limited, contiguous, and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones.\n[7]\nTo demonstrate that the proposed geographic area is limited, the regional center applicant should submit evidence demonstrating the linkages between proposed economic activities within the proposed area based on different variables. Examples of variables to demonstrate linkages between economic activities can include but are not limited to:\nRegional connectivity;\nThe labor pool and supply chain; and\nInterdependence between projects.\nMoreover, in assessing the likelihood that the proposed economic activity will promote economic growth in the proposed geographic area, an officer reviews the impact of the activity relative to relevant economic conditions. The size of the proposed area should be limited and consistent with the scope and scale of the proposed economic activity, as the regional center applicant is required to focus on a geographical region of the United States.\n[8]\nThe regional center applicant must present an economic analysis of its proposed economic activity in the proposed geographic area that is supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools.\n[9]\nThe Form I-924 instructions provide further information regarding the requirements of the economic analysis.\nB. Types of Regional Center Projects\nAn actual project refers to a specific project proposal that is supported by a\nMatter of Ho (PDF)\ncompliant business plan.\n[10]\nA hypothetical project refers to a project proposal that is not supported by a\nMatter of Ho (PDF)\ncompliant business plan.\nThe term exemplar refers to a sample Immigrant Petition by Alien Investor (Form I-526), filed with Form I-924 for an actual project. This type of regional center proposal contains copies of the commercial enterprise’s organizational and transactional documents, which USCIS reviews to determine if they are in compliance with established eligibility requirements.\n1. Hypothetical Projects\nIf the Form I-924 projects are hypothetical projects, general proposals and general predictions may be sufficient to determine that the proposed regional center will more likely than not promote economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment. A regional center applicant seeking review of a hypothetical project should clarify in the Form I-924 submission that the project is hypothetical. General proposals and predictions may include a description of the project parameters, such as:\nProposed project activities, industries, locations, and timelines;\nA general market analysis of the proposed job creating activities and explanation regarding how the proposed project activities are likely to promote economic growth and create jobs; and\nA description, along with supporting evidence, of the regional center principals’ relevant experience and expertise.\nWhile hypothetical project submissions are sufficient for regional center designation, previous determinations based on hypothetical projects will not receive deference. Actual projects will receive a de novo officer review during subsequent filings (for example, through the adjudication of an amended Form I-924 application, including the actual project details or the first Form I-526 immigrant investor petition).\nOrganizational and transactional supporting documents are not required for a hypothetical project. If a regional center applicant desires a compliance review of organizational and transactional documents, the application must include an actual project with a\nMatter of Ho (PDF)\ncompliant business plan and an exemplar immigrant investor petition.\n2. Actual Projects\nApplications for regional center designation based on actual projects may require more details than a hypothetical project to demonstrate that the proposal contains verifiable details and is supported by economically or statistically sound forecasting tools. A regional center applicant seeking review of an actual project should clarify in the Form I-924 submission that the project is actual.\nActual projects require a\nMatter of Ho (PDF)\ncompliant comprehensive business plan that provides verifiable detail on how jobs will be created. Absent fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legal deficiency,\n[11]\nUSCIS defers to prior determinations based on actual projects when evaluating subsequent filings under the project involving the same material facts and issues.\nOrganizational and transactional documents for the new commercial enterprise are not required. If a regional center applicant desires review of organizational and transactional documents for program compliance, the regional center application must be accompanied by an exemplar Form I-526 immigrant investor petition.\nIf regional center applicants opt not to file a Form I-924 amendment, the investor should identify his or her Form I-526 immigrant investor petition as an actual project being presented for the first time. Additionally, the immigrant petition should contain an affirmative statement signed by a regional center principal confirming that the regional center is aware of the specific project being presented for the first time as part of the immigrant investor petition.\nIn cases where the regional center application is filed based on actual projects that do not contain sufficient verifiable detail, USCIS may approve the projects as hypothetical projects if they contain the requisite general proposals and predictions. The projects approved as hypotheticals, however, do not receive deference in subsequent filings.\nIn cases where some projects are approvable as actual projects, and others are not approvable or only approvable as hypothetical projects, the approval notice should identify which projects have been approved as actual projects and will be accorded deference. The approval notice should also identify projects that have been approved as hypothetical projects but will not be accorded deference.\n3. Exemplar Filings\nRegional center applications, based on actual projects, including a Form I-526 immigrant investor exemplar petition, require more details than a hypothetical or actual project submitted without an exemplar. A regional center applicant seeking review of an exemplar should state that the project is an actual project with a Form I-526 exemplar.\nExemplar filings require a\nMatter of Ho (PDF)\ncompliant comprehensive business plan that provides verifiable detail on how jobs will be created, as well as organizational and transactional documents for the new commercial enterprise.\nAbsent fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legal deficiency, officer determinations based on exemplar filings are accorded deference in subsequent filings under the project with the same material facts and issues.\nWhile an amended Form I-924 is not required to perfect a hypothetical project once the actual project details are available, some applicants may choose to file an amended Form I-924 application with a Form I-526 exemplar to obtain a favorable determination. These exemplar filings are accorded deference in subsequent related filings, absent material change, fraud, willful misrepresentation, or a legally deficient determination.\nC. Regional Center Annual Reporting\nDesignated regional centers must file a Supplement to Form I-924 (Form I-924A) annually that demonstrates continued eligibility for designation as a regional center in the EB-5 Program.\n[12]\nThe regional center must file the form within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year (between October 1 and December 29). The Form I-924A instructions specifically list required information that must be submitted.\n[13]\nIf the regional center fails to file the required annual report, USCIS issues a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) to the regional center for failing to provide the required information. This may ultimately result in the termination of the regional center’s designation if the regional center fails to respond or does not file a response which adequately demonstrates continued eligibility.\nD. Regional Center Amendments\nBecause businesses’ strategies constantly evolve, with new opportunities identified and existing plans improved, a regional center may amend a previously approved designation. The Form I-924 instructions provide information regarding the submission of regional center amendment requests.\n[14]\nTo improve processing efficiencies and predictability in subsequent filings, many regional centers may seek to amend the Form I-924 approval to reflect changes in economic analysis and job creation estimates. Such amendments, however, are not required in order for individual investors to proceed with filing the immigrant petitions or petitions to remove conditions on residence based on the additional jobs created, or to be created, in additional industries.\nFormal amendments to an approved regional center’s designation are not required when a regional center changes its industries of focus, business plans, or economic methodologies; however, a regional center may find it advantageous to seek USCIS approval of such changes before they are adjudicated in individual immigrant investor petitions.\nRequests to Change Geographic Area\nWhen a regional center requests to expand its geographic area, the proposed geographic area must be limited, contiguous, and consistent with the purpose of concentrating pooled investment in defined economic zones.\n[15]\n​\nAny requests for geographic area expansion made on or after February 22, 2017 are adjudicated under the current guidance in the Form I-924 instructions which requires that a Form I-924 amendment must be filed, and approved, to expand the regional center’s geographic area. The Form I-924 amendment must be approved before an I-526 petitioner may demonstrate eligibility at the time of filing his or her petition based on an investment in the expanded area.\nIf the regional center’s geographic area expansion request was submitted either through a Form I-924 amendment or Form I-526 petition filed prior to February 22, 2017, and the request is ultimately approved, USCIS will continue to adjudicate additional Form I-526 petitions associated with investments in that area under prior policy guidance issued on May 30, 2013.\n[16]\nThat policy did not require a formal amendment to expand a regional center’s geographic area, and permitted concurrent filing of the Form I-526 prior to approval of the geographic area amendment.\nE. Termination of a Regional Center Designation\nUSCIS issues a NOIT if:\nUSCIS determines that a regional center no longer serves the purpose of promoting economic growth, including increased export sales, improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment; or\nThe regional center fails to submit required information to USCIS.\n[17]\nThe NOIT will provide the grounds for termination and provide at least 30 days from receipt of the NOIT for the regional center to respond to the allegations in the NOIT. The regional center may offer evidence to contest the allegations in the NOIT. If the regional center overcomes the allegations in the NOIT, USCIS issues a Notice of Reaffirmation that affirms the regional center’s designation.\nIf the regional center fails to overcome the allegations in the NOIT, USCIS terminates the regional center’s participation in the Regional Center Program. In this case, USCIS notifies the regional center of the termination, the reasons for termination, and the right to file a motion, appeal, or both. The regional center may appeal the decision to USCIS’ Administrative Appeals Office within 30 days after service of notice (33 days, if the notice was mailed).\n[18]\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nFor a definition of indirect jobs, see Chapter 2, Eligibility Requirements, Section D, Creation of Jobs, Subsection 4, Measuring Job Creation [6 USCIS-PM G.2(D)(4)].\n[^ 2]\nSee Section 610(a) of the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993, Pub. L. 102-395, 106 Stat. 1828, 1874 (October 6, 1992), as amended.\n[^ 3]\nAn applicant can submit a general prediction which addresses the prospective impact of the capital investment projects sponsored by the regional center, regionally or nationally.

An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue an interpretive rule or one that amends or repeals an existing interpretive rule,\n[7]\nor when modifying rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\n[8]\nHowever, the instruction to not require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification was a policy change in response to the resource strain of ongoing litigation. As with all other policy guidance USCIS issues, these updates and clarifications to officers do not add to the substantive regulations, create legally binding rights, obligations, or change the substantive standards by which USCIS will evaluate SIJ petitions. Accordingly, USCIS published no Federal Register notices requesting public comment because public notice is not required for these internal policy changes and clarifications.\nUnfair Surprise and Reliance Interest\nAn agency can change its interpretation of a regulation at different times in its history as long as the interpretative changes create no unfair surprise.\n[9]\nIn this case, USCIS is not changing its policy regarding SIJ adjudications. USCIS is updating this guidance to clarify what the law and regulations permit or require because of potential confusion. It has never been USCIS official policy to grant SIJ classification based on a state judge’s order that is sought primarily to permit the alien to obtain lawful immigration status.\nUSCIS has analyzed the potential for and taken into account serious reliance interests that may be engendered by the practices USCIS officers may have followed prior to this clarification. USCIS acknowledges that a person who may have been approved for SIJ classification before this policy alert may no longer be approved by an officer following this clarifying guidance in rendering their decision. An advocate or representative of an SIJ petitioner, not knowing of this policy, may erroneously petition the state court judge who is handling their client’s case to issue an order with findings of fact in support of the petitioner’s eligibility for SIJ that does not provide relief from parental abuse, neglect, abandonment or a similar basis under state law. However, the statutory and regulatory eligibility criteria have never permitted SIJ classification to be approved using such state court orders, nor has it been official USCIS policy. Therefore, an SIJ petitioner cannot be said to have acted in reliance on the continuation of a practice and policy that has not been a USCIS practice and policy and which is contrary to the law. USCIS must limit the approval of SIJ classification to cases who are eligible based on a valid court order as required by the INA regardless of its effects on parties who may rely on erroneous state court orders.\nWith respect to the policy change to no longer require evidence that a state court had jurisdiction to place the juvenile in the custody of the unfit parent(s) in order to make a qualifying determination regarding the viability of parental reunification, USCIS made that change in response to the strain of litigation. USCIS anticipated that the change would not negatively impact petitioners with potential reliance interests, rather it would reduce their evidentiary burden.\nImplementation\nUSCIS implemented this policy update immediately, as it was merely a clarification. However, USCIS still allowed interested parties an opportunity to comment by providing a 10-day comment period, as is generally provided for Policy Manual publications.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nSee Chapter 2, Eligibility Requirements, Section A, General [\n6 USCIS-PM J.2(A)\n] and Section B, Age-out Protections For Filing with USCIS [\n6 USCIS-PM J.2(B)\n].\n[^ 2]\nSee Chapter 2, Eligibility Requirements, Section C, Juvenile Court Order [\n6 USCIS-PM J.2(C)\n].\n[^ 3]\nSee Chapter 2, Eligibility Requirements, Section C, Juvenile Court Order, Subsection 1, Dependency or Custody [\n6 USCIS-PM J.2(C)(1)\n].\n[^ 4]\nSee Chapter 2, Eligibility Requirements, Section D, USCIS Consent [\n6 USCIS-PM J.2(D)\n].\n[^ 5]\nSee Chapter 3, Documentation and Evidence, Section A, Juvenile Court Order(s) and Administrative Documents, Subsection 1, Qualifying Juvenile Court Determinations [\n6 USCIS-PM J.3(A)(1)\n].\n[^ 6]\nSee Chapter 2, Eligibility Requirements, Section C, Juvenile Court Order, Subsection 2, Parental Reunification [\n6 USCIS-PM J.2(C)(2)\n].\n[^ 7]\nSee\nPerez v.

In\nMatter of O. Vazquez,\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found that the term “sought to acquire” was ambiguous and that the alien might also satisfy the provision “by showing that there are extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond their control.”\n[1]\nHowever, neither\nMatter of O. Vasquez\nnor other authorities address how to treat the visa availability periods of less than 1 year that coincide with an alien’s period of extraordinary circumstances for purposes of\nINA 203(h)\n. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, USCIS provides the applicant with another 1-year period to seek to acquire when the visa next becomes available again solely to ensure that the applicant has the benefit of the entire 1-year period afforded by Congress under\nINA 203(h)\n.\n[2]\nOnce the visa next becomes available, the applicant’s Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) age is calculated based on this next visa availability date.\n[3]\nUSCIS has not previously issued policy guidance regarding extraordinary circumstances and the unavailability of a visa.\nIn accordance with\nMatter of O. Vazquez,\nif the applicant establishes that extraordinary circumstances prevented the potential applicant from timely filing an adjustment of status application or otherwise seeking to acquire LPR status when a visa is available for less than a year, then it is reasonable for the agency to find that the applicant satisfied the sought to acquire provision during that period. Because USCIS had not previously addressed the issue of extraordinary circumstances and failure to seek to acquire prior to unavailability, the foregoing policy is new guidance. Accordingly, USCIS is supplementing its interpretation here.\nIf USCIS were to account for extraordinary circumstances only during periods when the visa was available for a continuous 1-year period, but not during periods when the visa was available for less than 1 year, then USCIS would have to use the next visa availability date for purposes of an age calculation.\n[4]\nThis would be the case even though it was beyond the control of the applicant to file earlier because of extraordinary circumstances. USCIS believes such an interpretation of the sought to acquire requirement, considering the statutory scheme limiting visa availability and the potential for visa retrogression in preference cases, does not comport with the interpretation of “sought to acquire” as provided in the BIA’s decision in\nMatter of O. Vazquez\n.\nBy issuing this guidance, USCIS is clarifying the interplay between the statutory scheme governing visa limitations and the BIA’s interpretation of “sought to acquire.” Through this guidance, USCIS provides new, clear instructions and ensures a uniform approach within the agency. The updated guidance, moreover, is consistent with the purpose of the CSPA, to protect certain beneficiaries from losing eligibility for immigrant visas due to aging out. USCIS also has considered the extent to which this policy update may adversely impact interested parties or upset reliance interests. Given that the guidance is a product of an interplay between statutory provisions governing visa limitation and binding BIA precedent, and the fact that USCIS previously did not have any guidance on the issue of a visa becoming unavailable during the first year of availability, the existence of extraordinary circumstances during the initial period of availability, and failure to seek to acquire during the initial period of availability, USCIS believes interested parties will have only developed serious reliance interests, if at all, based on the holding of\nMatter of O. Vazquez\n.\nUSCIS recognizes that given the visa allocation scheme provided by Congress, this new policy guidance means that some aliens may be eligible for CSPA benefits because they will be considered a child based on an earlier visa availability date, which in turn may cause other visa applicants to wait longer for an available visa. However, the current statutory scheme which permits certain individuals to be considered children for immigration purposes already results in other aliens having to wait longer for a visa to become available. Given that the updated guidance aims to ensures a uniform interpretation of law and provide guidance in an area that has not been expressly addressed, the implications of this guidance are generally likely to adversely affect the same proportion of individuals as those impacted by USCIS’ current implementation of CSPA. USCIS considers this impact to be outweighed by the benefits of avoiding family separation so that eligible aliens may adjust status with their parents. For these reasons, USCIS believes that, if there are any, reliance interests do not outweigh the benefits provided by this updated guidance.\nTherefore, USCIS believes that\nMatter of O. Vazquez\nis best implemented by considering an applicant to satisfy the sought to acquire provision when the visa is available for less than 1 year if the alien did not apply during that period but the period is covered by extraordinary circumstances.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nSee\nMatter of O.

That Visa Bulletin chart in effect corresponded to what is currently the “Final Action Dates” chart. In October 2015, DOS began publishing two charts in the DOS Visa Bulletin consisting of a “Dates for Filing” chart (which notifies beneficiaries when they may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center (NVC)) and a Final Action Dates chart (which informs when a visa is authorized for issuance).\nBetween the enactment of the CSPA in 2002 and October 2015, it was understood that an immigrant visa “bec[ame] available” for the CSPA age calculation based on the chart published in the Visa Bulletin now known as the Final Action Dates chart. On May 23, 2018, following the publication of the two charts in the Visa Bulletin, USCIS issued policy guidance clarifying that it continued to only consider a visa available for the CSPA age calculation based on the Final Action Dates chart.\n[4]\nOn February 14, 2023, USCIS issued updated policy guidance that a visa becomes available to calculate CSPA age for an alien at the same time USCIS considers a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application.\n[5]\nWhen USCIS determined there were more immigrant visas available for a fiscal year than there were known aliens for such visas, and USCIS designated the Dates for Filing chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin\n[6]\nto determine eligibility for filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Dates for Filing chart when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. When USCIS designated the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin for use by aliens when filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Final Action Dates when calculating the alien’s CSPA age.\n[7]\nNeither CSPA nor DHS regulations define when a visa becomes available for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under\nINA 203(h)\n, and there are no precedent federal court decisions or published administrative decisions on this issue. USCIS carefully considered the February 14, 2023 interpretation of\nINA 203(h)\n, including in light of the Supreme Court decision in\nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n(\nLoper Bright\n).\n[8]\nUSCIS believes that utilizing the Final Action Date is the most faithful alignment with the statutory text of\nINA 203(h)\n[9]\nand the structure of\nINA 203\nas a whole,\n[10]\nand effectuates the purpose of\nINA 203(h)\nas recognized by courts.\n[11]\nContrasted with\nINA 201(f)(1)\n, which broadly freezes the age of certain immediate relatives on the date of filing the immigrant petition,\nINA 203(h)(1)\npermits only certain preference aliens to be deemed a child for immigration purposes based on a particular formula which, when enacted, was centered around when a visa could actually be allocated and used for adjustment of status or immigrant visa processing. For adjustment cases, the application of the provisions of\nINA 203(h)\nis generally a retrospective analysis conducted at the time of final adjustment adjudication alone as opposed to eligibility to file under\nINA 245(a)\n.\nFurthermore, using the Final Action Date chart is most consistent with the longstanding interpretation of\nINA 203(h)\nthat USCIS had relied on prior to February 14, 2023, and is closest to the contemporaneous understanding of visa availability at the time Congress enacted CSPA. Interpretations issued contemporaneously with the statute, and which have remained consistent over time, are especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning.\n[12]\nWhen Congress enacted CSPA, it did so with the knowledge and understanding of existing law and processes provided by the agencies within their authorities and expertise, including the operation of the DOS Visa Bulletin.\n[13]\nDOS and USCIS utilized the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under\nINA 203(h)\nuntil the February 14, 2023 policy change, and this interpretation had remained consistent for over 20 years.\nFinally, by returning to the Final Action Dates chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation,\n[14]\nDHS ensures a uniform interpretation of\nINA 203(h)\nacross government agencies and establishes parity for CSPA age calculations for aliens who apply for adjustment of status with USCIS and immigrant visas with DOS. After the February 14, 2023 policy update, USCIS and DOS interpreted\nINA 203(h)\ninconsistently, which resulted in inconsistent treatment of aliens who applied for adjustment of status in the United States and aliens who applied for an immigrant visa with DOS abroad. Even after implementing the October 2015 changes to the Visa Bulletin, DOS considered the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin as the only dates that should be used to calculate the CSPA age for aliens who apply for an immigrant visa.\n[15]\nTherefore, an alien filing for adjustment of status in the United States may have been considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA when USCIS designates the earlier dates in the Dates for Filing chart while an alien who must apply for an immigrant visa outside the United States may have been ineligible to immigrate as a child if his or her calculated CSPA age is 21 or older when a visa became available according to the later dates in the Final Action Dates chart.\n[16]\nUSCIS is cognizant that the February 14, 2023 policy may have engendered reliance interests, and USCIS has assessed the impact of this policy change on aliens, including aliens with a pending adjustment of status application. This policy change means that the alien could have a visa immediately available for purposes of filing the adjustment of status application while a visa may not have become available under the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA calculation, if USCIS designates the Dates of Filing chart for purposes of filing adjustment of status applications in a given month. In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he or she would be considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA and, thus, whether the alien would be eligible for adjustment of status application once a visa is available to calculate his or her CSPA age. That was one of the triggering reasons for the February 14, 2023 policy. However, as explained, the February 14, 2023 policy has neither been longstanding nor are these considerations of such nature that they would be engendering significant reliance interests for aliens who are impacted by the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, specifically, aliens who have not yet filed adjustment of status applications.\n[17]\nEvery alien filing a request with USCIS assumes the risk that he or she may be ineligible for the benefit under U.S. immigration laws, and thus, may have paid a USCIS fee without obtaining the benefit. Aliens seeking eligibility to adjust status believing that they are considered a child under CSPA are no different. The short duration of the policy, and the lack of associated rights related to the February 14, 2023 guidance for aliens who file adjustment of status applications after the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, the fact that such aliens have not paid a fee for an adjustment of status application, and the absence of any guarantee that the alien would be eligible to remain a child under\nINA 203(h)\nor that the application for adjustment of status will be approved as a matter of discretion dilutes the strength of the alien’s reliance on the past practice.\n[18]\nThus, while USCIS is always cognizant of any reliance interests no matter how small, USCIS believes that, for the reasons outlined in the policy guidance, the policy concerns addressed with this update outweigh the alien’s concerns that prompted the February 14, 2023 policy.\n[19]\nTo address reliance interests of those aliens who have already filed adjustment of status applications, USCIS determined that it will apply this policy change prospectively only to applications filed on or after August 15, 2025. USCIS continues to apply the February 14, 2023 policy to aliens whose adjustment of status application are pending with USCIS before August 15, 2025.\nMoreover, if an alien demonstrates extraordinary circumstances for not applying for adjustment of status during the period of the former policy between February 14, 2023 and August 14, 2025 where a visa was available for CSPA age calculations at the same time a visa was immediately available for an alien to apply for adjustment of status under the February 14, 2023 policy, USCIS calculates the alien’s age under that former policy.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nSee\nRevising Age Calculation Under the Child Status Protection Act\n, PA-2025-15, issued August 8, 2025 (effective August 15, 2025).\n[^ 2]\nSee\nAge Calculation Under the Child Status Protection (PDF, 345 KB)\n,\nPA-2023-2, issued February 14, 2023.\n[^ 3]\nSee\n8 CFR 245.1(g)\n.\n[^ 4]\nSee\nChild Status Protection Act (PDF, 167.53 KB)\n, PA-2018-05, issued May 23, 2018.\n[^ 5]\nSee\nAge Calculation under Child Status Protection Act (PDF, 345 KB)\n, PA-2023-02, issued February 14, 2023.\n[^ 6]\nSee the DOS\nVisa Bulletin\nwebpage.\n[^ 7]\nSee\nAge Calculation under Child Status Protection Act (PDF, 345 KB)\n, PA-2023-02, issued February 14, 2023\n[^ 8]\nSee\nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n(PDF)\n,\n603 U.S. 369 (2024).\n[^ 9]\nAt least one court has addressed the meaning of when an immigrant visa “becomes available” under\nINA 203(h)\n. In\nLin Liu v. Smith,\n515 F. Supp. 3d 193, 197 (S.D.N.Y. 2021), the court determined that the ordinary meaning of the term “available” under\nINA 203(h)\nmeant that “a visa number cannot be considered available until it can be issued legally,” and thus, found that DOS was correct to tether availability for purposes of\nINA 203(h)\nto the Final Action Dates chart. The holding in this District court decision does not have precedential value and is not binding on USCIS, see, for example,\nMatter of Rosales Vargas\n, 27 I&N Dec. 745, 749 n.7 (BIA 2020); nevertheless, USCIS believes that the reasoning contained in this decision is persuasive in the context of “becomes available” under\nINA 203(h)\n.\n[^ 10]\nCongress embedded\nINA 203(h)\nwithin\nINA 203\n, which addresses the allocation of immigrant visas generally. In this section, Congress authorized DOS to administer the visa quota system consistent with numerical limitations imposed by Congress. See\nINA 203(e)-(g)\n. The statute authorizes DOS to make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued and to rely on those numbers when authorizing the issuance of immigrant visas. See\nINA 203(e)-(g)\n. See\n22 CFR 42.51\nand\n22 CFR 42.54\n. The availability of an immigrant visa under\nINA 203(h)\nis thus closely tied to DOS’ allocation of immigrant visa numbers for the issuance of immigrant visas, for which DOS uses the Final Action Dates chart. See\nINA 245(b)\n(upon approval of an adjustment of status application under\nINA 245(a)\n, DOS reduces the number of corresponding visas authorized for issuance under\nINA 202\nand\nINA 203\nby one within the class to which the alien is chargeable for the fiscal year then current).\n[^ 11]\nIn analyzing the statute’s plain language and structure, as well as Congress’ contemporaneous understanding of immigration law at the time of the CSPA’s enactment, courts have recognized that Congress only intended the CSPA to address children aging out because of delays in the adjudication of immigrant petitions, not because of delays due to statutory limits on visa allocations. For example, see\nScialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio\n, 573 U.S. 41, 53 (2014) (plurality op.) (“But the time in between—the months or, more likely, years the alien spends simply waiting for a visa to become available—is not similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the immigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions, can still ‘age out’ . . . prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.”). Using the Final Action Dates chart is more consistent with this purpose because it only mitigates the consequences of the administrative delays, but not any additional time spent waiting before DOS can authorize a visa number for issuance.\n[^ 12]\nSee\nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n(PDF)\n,\n603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024).\n[^ 13]\nFor example, see\nH.R. Rep. 107-45\n, p. 2, 2002 U.S.C.C.A.N. 640, 641(2001) (describing the mechanics of immigrant visa availability and the associated waiting list).\n[^ 14]\nAs it is the case with all USCIS Policy Manual guidance, this update to current USCIS policy guidance is based on USCIS’ interpretation of the applicable terms in the INA and the necessary policies and procedures to implement them. An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue interpretive rules, general statements of policy or rules of agency organization and procedure or practice. See\n5 U.S.C. 553\n. Additionally, this policy guidance relates to the efforts of USCIS to control the status, exit, and entry of aliens, which constitutes a foreign affairs function under the APA.

Effective October 29, 2019, USCIS amended its policy guidance to address these concerns, and determined that children of members of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employees stationed outside of the United States would not be eligible for citizenship acquisition under INA 320.\n[4]\nOn March 26, 2020, the Citizenship for Children of Military Members and Civil Servants Act was enacted,\n[5]\namending INA 320, so that a child residing with his or her U.S. citizen parent, who is stationed outside of the United States as a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee, or is residing in marital union with a member of the U.S. armed forces or a U.S. government employee who is stationed outside of the United States, acquires citizenship under INA 320 if all requirements of INA 320(c) and INA 320(a)(1)-(2) are met. In line with the statute, USCIS rescinds its previous guidance, clarifying that these children are eligible to acquire citizenship under INA 320 if all other requirements under INA 320 are met.\nThe amendment to INA 320 applies to children who were under the age of 18 on March 26, 2020.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nEven though the child of a member of the U.S. armed forces or U.S. government employee stationed outside of the United States may be eligible to apply for a Certificate of Citizenship under\nINA 322\nsince he or she resides outside of the United States, USCIS interpreted the child to meet residency requirements under\nINA 320\nas well, which formerly required the child to be residing in the United States with his or her parent to acquire citizenship.\n[^ 2]\nFor example, U.S. government employees, including members of the U.S. armed forces, are eligible to apply for an exception to the continuous residence requirement for naturalization under INA 316 as long as their residency outside of the United States was on behalf of the U.S. government.
