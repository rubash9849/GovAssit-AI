However, we cannot guarantee that we will grant every expedite request.\nOverseas Naturalization for Spouses of Service Members\nUnder section 319(e)(2) of the INA and 8 U.S.C. section 1443a, a lawful permanent resident (LPR) who is married to a U.S. service member can naturalize outside the United States without traveling to the U.S. In general, to be eligible for naturalization abroad under section 319(e)(2) of the INA and 8 U.S.C. section 1443a, you must:\nBe the spouse of a U.S. service member who is stationed outside the United States in that capacity;\nBe authorized to accompany your spouse outside the United States by your spouse’s official orders;\nReside outside the United States in marital union with your spouse; and\nMeet the requirements of either section 316(a) or 319(a) of the INA at the time you file your naturalization application.\nSection 316(a) applies to you if you have been:\nAn LPR for at least five years immediately before the date you file the naturalization application; and\nPhysically present in the U.S. for periods totaling at least two and a half years.\nSection 319(a) applies to you if:\nYou have been an LPR and have resided in the United States for at least three continuous years immediately before the date you file your naturalization application;\nYou have lived in marital union with your U.S. citizen spouse for at least three years immediately before you file your naturalization application;\nYour U.S citizen spouse has been a U.S. citizen for at least three years immediately before you file your naturalization application; and\nYou have been physically present in the U.S. for periods totaling at least 18 months out of the three years immediately preceding the date you file your application. Time spent living in marital union with your spouse who is abroad under military orders counts toward the continuous residence and physical presence requirements.\nYou can file for naturalization up to 90 calendar days before you meet the time requirement for being an LPR. For example, if you are filing under section 319(a), you can file when you have been an LPR for two years and 275 days. However, if you file early under section 319(a):\nYou must have been married to your U.S. citizen spouse for at least three years at the time you file;\nYour spouse must have been a U.S. citizen for at least three years at the time you file; and\nYou must meet all other eligibility requirements (such as good moral character).\nUse our early filing calculator to determine your\nearliest filing date\nfor naturalizations.

For additional information on eligibility USCIS Policy Manual Volume 12, Part H, Children of U.S. Citizens,\nChapter 4, Automatic Acquisition of Citizenship after Birth (INA 320)\n.\nCertain children of service members who have not already acquired citizenship automatically under INA 320 can become naturalized U.S. citizens under section 322 of the INA without having to travel to the U.S. for any part of the naturalization process. For additional information on eligibility USCIS Policy Manual Volume 12, Part H, Children of U.S. Citizens,\nChapter 5, Child Residing Outside of the United States (INA 322)\n.\nAdjusting Status for Spouses for Service Members\nGenerally, spouses need to have lawful permanent resident status before naturalizing. To apply for adjustment of status the spouse must file\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n, and the service member must file\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n, including the biometrics fee.\nIf the spouse of a service member receives an adjustment of status interview appointment notice while the service member is deployed, the USCIS office will still conduct the interview.
