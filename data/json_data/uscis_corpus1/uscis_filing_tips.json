      "content": "Filing Guidance\nThis page contains filing locations, checklists and other resources to help you understand our forms and filing requirements. To find a complete list of our forms, visit the\nAll Forms\npage.\nWhere to File\nEach form has a webpage with important information about how to complete the form and where to file it. If you do not file your form with the correct office or with the correct fee, you will experience processing delays.\nPlease do NOT mail your application or petition to the “HQPDI” address on any form—that address is for submitting comments on the form itself.\nDirect Filing Addresses by Form Type\nSome forms have a separate webpage that tell you where to file your form, including:\nForm I-102, Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Departure Document\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\nForm I-129F, Petition for Alien Fiancé(e)\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\nForm I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After Deportation or Removal\nForm I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion\nForm I-360, Immigrant Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility\nForm I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\nForm I-817, Application for Family Unity Benefits\nForm I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\nForm I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition\nInstructions and Checklists\nWe strongly encourage you to read the instructions for the form you are submitting before you complete and submit the form.\nIn some circumstances, the form webpage will say that requirements for that form have changed, but the form’s instructions have not yet been revised. This warning will be shown in the Special Instructions section of the form landing page. Please make sure you follow those special instructions.\nMany of our form pages have a checklist that will help ensure you submit all of the required documentation with your form. However, these checklists do not replace the official form instructions.\nFiling Tips and Requirements\nPhotographic Requirements\nYou may have to submit photographs with your form. You can find the specifications for photographs in the form instructions.\nFiling Tips:\nYou can read our\nForm Filing Tips\nwebpage for general information on how to submit your form.\nAnnual Reporting Information / Filing Tips: Form I-924A, Annual Certification of Regional Center\nTips for Filing Form I-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member\nFiling Tips for Form I-360\nTip Sheet: Applying for Form N-600K, Application for Certificate of Citizenship\nTips for Filing Form I-864, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA\nTips for Filing Form I-864EZ, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA\nFBI Privacy Notice\nUSCIS may use your biometrics to obtain the criminal history records of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for identity verification, to determine eligibility, to create immigration documents (for example, Permanent Resident Card, Employment Authorization Document), or any purpose authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended and any other applicable statute. You may obtain a copy of your own FBI record using the procedures outlined at 28 CFR 16.30-16.34. For more information, please visit:\nwww.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/compact-council/guiding-principles-noncriminal-justice-applicants-privacy-rights\n.\nFor information regarding how the FBI will use your fingerprints, please visit\nwww.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/compact-council/privacy-act-statement\n.\nDownloading and Printing Immigration Forms\nWe provide\nfree\nfillable forms through our website in PDF format, which means you can type your answers directly on the form instead of printing a blank form and writing your answers by hand.\nFor the best results, we suggest you download the PDF to your computer and complete the form using the latest version of Adobe Acrobat Reader rather than completing the PDF through your web browser. You can download Adobe Acrobat Reader for free from the\nAdobe website\n.\nDownload Instructions\nAfter opening the form in your web browser:\nIn Microsoft Edge, click the\nSave\nicon (second from the right) in the ribbon at the top of the page, or press Ctrl (or Command ) and S on your keyboard. After saving the form to your computer, click on the\nform\nicon to\nreopen\nit in Adobe Acrobat Reader.\nIn Google Chrome or Firefox, click the\nDownload\nicon (second from the right) in the ribbon at the top of the page or press Ctrl (or Command) and S on your keyboard. After saving the form to your computer, click on the\nform\nicon to\nreopen\nit in Adobe Acrobat Reader.\nIf you receive the error message: “An error occurred. An error was encountered while processing the file. Some features might not work.”, the Chrome extension might be on.\nYou can remove or disable the Chrome extension by:\n1.    Opening Chrome;\n2.    Clicking the ellipsis in the right corner;\n3.    Clicking \"Settings\";\n4.    Selecting “Extensions”; and\n5.    Removing or turning off the Chrome extension on the “Adobe Acrobat: PDF edit, convert, sign tools” tab.\nIn Safari, open the form, hover your mouse toward the bottom-center of the screen to bring up the gray icon, and click the\nDownload\nicon on the right corner of the gray icon, or press Command and S on your keyboard. After saving the form to your computer, click on the\nform\nicon to\nreopen\nit in Adobe Acrobat Reader.\nIf you complete and print the form to mail, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition. If any of the form’s pages are missing or are from a different form edition, we may reject your form.\nIf you are required to sign the form , you must write your signature by hand before submitting your form. We will not accept a stamped or typewritten name in place of a signature.\nUSCIS forms are available for free on our website. You can find the latest version of any USCIS form on our\nForms\npage.\nWarning\n: Many non-USCIS websites offer immigration forms for downloading. These sites may ask you to pay for immigration forms and may not have the correct form version.\nDo not pay for any USCIS form.\nIn some circumstances, your case may be delayed or rejected if you use an outdated form.\n“DS” Forms and other Non-USCIS Forms\nCertain forms relating to visas, passports and travel are not available on this site. If you are looking for “DS” forms relating to visas and passports, check the\nDepartment of State website\n.

      "content": "Tips for Filing Forms by Mail\nThis page contains tips for filing paper forms by mail.\nHowever, you can file many USCIS forms online. You can review the list of\nForms Available to File Online\n, check out the\nBenefits of Filing Online\n, and learn how to\nCreate a USCIS Online Account\n. If you are filing online, see our\nTips for Filing Forms Online\npage.\nYou may download and print forms for free from the\nAll Forms\npage.\nPlease be sure to carefully read and follow the form filing instructions. Form fees, eligibility requirements, fee waiver eligibility, required documents, and mailing addresses vary depending on which form you are filing and why you are filing it. These tips will help ensure we accept your application, petition, or request package for processing.\nComplete Your Paper Form Accurately\nYou can\ndownload forms from our website\n, complete them electronically, and then print your forms to submit by mail. If you need help downloading and printing forms, read our\ninstructions\n. Do not mail a form if you have already filed it online. If you print out an online form and mailed to the lockbox, we will reject it.\nOnly use the current form edition when downloading and completing a form.\nEnsure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of the printed pages and that you complete all pages with the same edition of the form. If any of the form’s pages are missing or are completed with a different edition of the form, we may reject your application.\nIf you hand write your answers, use black ink. Make sure that everything you write on the form is clear, so we can easily read the information on the scanned image we produce when we process your form.\nDo not use highlighters, correction fluid, or correction tape. We use both black-and-white and grayscale scanners that will not properly read information that is greyed out, highlighted, or corrected using correction fluid or tape. If you make an error, start over with a clean form.\nComplete the entire form, unless the form directs you to skip 1 or more items. If you do not complete all parts of the form, we may reject your submission for missing information.\nRemember to sign your form in the space provided for your signature. We will reject and return any unsigned form. For more information on signatures, see the\nUSCIS Policy Manual\n.\nPay the correct\nfee\n. We will reject forms submitted with incorrect or incomplete fees. Use the\nFee Calculator\nto help you determine the correct fee.\nIf you are filing multiple applications, petitions, or requests, we recommend sending separate payments for each application. If you submit 1 payment for multiple forms and we reject 1 of those forms, we will reject all the other forms included in that payments.\nAssemble Your Application, Petition, or Request\nWe recommend assembling your package in the following order:\nCheck or money order\nor\nForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions\n. If you are paying by check or money order, write the form you are filing and your A-Number or other applicable identification on the check or money order. If you are paying with a credit card, see our\nPay with a Credit Card\nwebpage.\nForm G-1145, Request for e-Notification\n(if applicable).\nForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative\n(if applicable).\nForm being filed.\nForm supplements being filed, if applicable.\nSupporting documentation:\nSubmit the documents or evidence listed in the form instructions.\nSupporting documents must be in English or accompanied by a complete English translation that the translator has certified as complete and accurate. The English translation must be accompanied by the translator's certification that they are competent to translate the foreign language into English.\nSubmit\nlegible copies of official documents\n. We may scan them in black and white or in grayscale. Legible copies are copies that:\nAre not blurry or faded;\nDo not have streaks or toner lines;\nAre not upside down, lopsided, skewed, or distorted;\nDo not have text or images that are obscured, partially cut off, or missing due to folded pages or improper copying; and\nDo not have pages that are completely illegible.\nDo not\nsend original documents unless they are specifically requested in the form instructions or applicable regulations. If you send original documents with your form when they are not required or requested, we may destroy them in accordance with the Federal Records Act and applicable U.S. National Archives and Records Administration-approved general retention schedules or agency-specific retention schedules. We will not automatically return your original documents if we did not specifically request them.\nIn most cases, a copy of a USCIS notice, if available, is acceptable evidence of a prior, related filing. If you prefer to provide a copy of a complete prior application, petition, or request in support of a new filing, please be sure that the prior application, petition, or request is clearly marked as a “COPY” at the top of each page to ensure we process it as intended.\nAll forms and supporting documents submitted must be single-sided, standard 8½ x 11 letter-size pages.\nPlease do not submit evidence using digital media, photo albums, scrapbooks, or binders. We cannot process them and will return them to you.\nWhen providing photos or other attachments, please provide your name at the top of the page or on the back of any photos. If you send original photos with your form, they may become part of the record or be destroyed.\nYou may number support pages and include the total number of pages being attached (for example, “page 1 of 11”).\nIf you forget to send in supporting documentation with your benefit request package, please\ndo not\nsubmit it in a separate package to a USCIS lockbox. If you have an\nonline account\nand are able to add your paper-filed case to the account, you can upload the supporting documentation in your online account. If you do not have an online account or cannot add your paper-filed case to your account, please keep the supporting documentation so you can submit it later to the appropriate location, upon request.\nMark the envelope and the cover letter with the type of submission. For example,\nOriginal Submission, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485)\n.\nMark the envelope and the cover letter with the form number. For example, Form I-129, Form I-360, Form I-485.\nWhen you prepare your packet, remember:\nDo not use binders or folders that we cannot easily disassemble.\nDo not use heavy-duty staples.\nDo not\nmail responses to Requests for Evidence (RFEs) or similar notices to a USCIS lockbox location. Instead, follow the instructions in the RFE regarding where to send your response.\nDo not mail evidence in support of a previously filed appeal or motion to a USCIS lockbox location. If you are submitting a brief or evidence in support of an appeal, please refer to the\nAAO Practice Manual\nor the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals Practice Manual\nfor instructions. For motions, you must submit any brief or additional evidence together with Form I-290B at the time of filing. If we issue an RFE related to your motion, we will provide specific instructions to submit the evidence using an online account or by mail.\nIf you are requesting premium processing service, submit only one Form I-907 for the associated, eligible form (such as Form I-140 or I-129).\nFiling Multiple Applications, Petitions, or Requests in the Same Envelope\nWe recommend only including multiple forms in the same envelope when the forms are related and eligible to be filed together (such as including a Form I-765 and Form I-131 with the Form I-485 that your eligibility is based on, or including multiple Forms I-485 or Forms N-400 for family members who are applying for adjustment or naturalization at the same time).\nDo not include unrelated forms in the same envelope when filing. Forms are unrelated if the decision on one form does not affect the decision on another. For example, if you plan to file Form I-765 and Form I-485, and whether or not we approve your Form I-485 does not affect your Form I-765, then we recommend you file each form in a separate envelope. Doing so may avoid routing issues that could make it take longer to process your form.\nIf you are filing multiple forms in the same envelope, write your name, date of birth, and A-Number (if any) exactly the same way on each form (unless you have had a legal change of name or date of birth and provide proof of that).\nIf you are filing forms from multiple individuals in the same envelope, clearly separate the cases and follow the guidelines described above in Assemble Your Application, Petition, or Request.\nIf you are responding to multiple RFEs in the same envelope, clearly separate the responses by form and follow the guidelines described above in Assemble Your Application, Petition, or Request.\nDo not mail responses to RFEs in the same envelope with unrelated applications, petitions, or requests.\nMail Your Application, Petition, or Request\nWhen addressing the package, be sure to enter the complete address provided on the USCIS website, including the Attn: line, which helps to ensure that we process and route the application, petition, or request.\nMail your forms to the address listed on that form’s webpage. You may send your forms through USPS, FedEx, DHL, or UPS.\nWe encourage you to save a copy of your payment, along with any tracking number provided by the courier, for your records and so you can verify the status of its delivery.\nIf you mail your application, petition, or request to the wrong filing location, we may reject it as improperly filed and return it to you to re-file.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n04/24/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

extra space is needed, at the top of each continuation sheet, include:\nthe name of the RC, and\nthe part of the form and item number for each answer\nReturn to top\nSection III: Filing Tips\nTip 1: Provide Accurate Information\nMake sure that the information provided on the form is accurate\nTip 2: Double Check Numbers\nBefore submitting the form, the RC should check and double check its numbers\nTip 3: Jobs Created vs. Jobs Maintained\nReport the total number of direct and indirect (including induced) jobs that were created during the time identified in Part 2\nOnly report “jobs maintained” for the relevant time period if there was investment in a “troubled business”\nIf no investment in a troubled business, all the jobs should be entered as “direct and indirect job creation”\nTip 4: Provide Job Calculation Methods\nTwo common methods are:\nEconomic impact modeling\nWhere job creation methodologies use inputs of expenditures, revenues, and/or direct jobs, the reported aggregate jobs created should be the result of those inputs\nduring the I-924A reporting period\nEstimates based on number of approved I-829 petitions\nWhere job creation estimates are based on the approval of I-829 petitions, 10 jobs should be reported for every I-829 petition approved within the reporting period\nNote: You may wish to include a sheet to explain how certain numbers were calculated\nEconomic Impact Modeling\nExample\nThe project: The construction and operation of a skilled nursing facility\nEconomic methodology presented when the project was first submitted to USCIS:\nCategory\nNAICS\nEligible Spending\nMultiplier\nDirect Jobs\nIndirect Jobs\nTotal Jobs\nConstruction\n23\n$10,000,000\n17.3689\n112\n61\n173\nArchitecture, Engineering and Related

months and\noperational\njobs are calculated as a result of direct hires\nYear 1:\nIf in the reporting period, $3 million was spent on hard construction and $2 million was spent on architecture and engineering services, the jobs created during the reporting period would be as follows:\nCategory\nNAICS\nEligible Spending\nMultiplier\nDirect Jobs\nIndirect Jobs\nTotal

construction was completed and the remaining $7 million was spent and the facilities became operational and four direct employees were hired, the jobs created during the reporting period would be as follows:\nCategory\nNAICS\nEligible Spending\nMultiplier\nDirect Jobs\nIndirect Jobs\nTotal Jobs\nConstruction\n23\n$7,000,000\n17.3689\n78\n43\n121\nResidential Care Facilities\n623\n1.2671\n4\n1\n5\nTOTAL\n126\nNote: The total construction expenditures in years one and two sum to the total anticipated expenditures. Therefore the total construction jobs credited for years one and two equal the total number of anticipated jobs.\nReturn to top\nSection IV: Notices of Intent to Terminate and Suggestions to Possibly Avoid Them\nReasons for a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT):\nFailure to submit required information to USCIS\nFailure to promote economic growth\nA NOIT signifies USCIS intentions to terminate the RC’s participation in the program\nExamples\nFailure to Submit Required Information\nNot filing Form I-924A: If an RC fails to file the required Form I-924A, the RC will receive a NOIT\nDeadline to file: on or before December 29 of the calendar year in which the fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) ended\nSteps to submit the Form I-924A (after a NOIT is issued)\nSend the missing I-924A to the California Service Center per the Form I-924A instructions;\nSend the response to the NOIT to the Immigrant Investor Program Office in Washington, D.C.\nYou may wish to include a copy of the Form I-924A and receipt notice, along with your NOIT response.

      "content": "Filing Fees\nAlert Type info\nAlert:\nUSCIS has implemented a new way to pay fees using electronic debit from a U.S. bank account. Effective immediately, individuals can make transactions directly to USCIS by completing and signing Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions, and filing it with their applications, petitions, or requests. USCIS will continue to accept paper check and money order payments in addition to credit and debit payments until Oct. 28, 2025.After Oct. 28, USCIS will accept\nonly\nACH debit transactions using Form G-1650 or credit card payments using Form G-1450 for forms filed by paper without an exemption. USCIS continues to accept online payments for forms filed online.\nAlert Type info\nALERT:\nOn July 18, 2025, USCIS\nannounced\nnew fees required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill.\nApplicants must submit the new fees with benefit requests postmarked on or after July 22, 2025. USCIS will reject any form postmarked on or after Aug. 21, 2025, without the proper fees.  For more information about these fees, please visit our\nFee Schedule\npage and our\nweb alert\n.\nA filing fee is required for many immigration forms. If you do not submit the correct fee, we will reject your form.\nOur Fees\nWe periodically adjust our fees. For a complete list of all USCIS fees, see our\nFee Schedule\n.\nYou can use our\nFee Calculator\nto determine the exact filing and, if applicable, biometric services fees for any form.\nHow to Pay USCIS Filing Fees\nHow you pay your USCIS filing fees (including biometric services fees and other fees, if applicable) will depend on whether you are inside or outside of the United States.\nIf you live outside the United States or its territories\nIf you live outside the United States or its territories and you want to file your application, petition, or request where you live, go to the\nForms\nsection of our website to determine if you can file your form at an international office. We do not accept all forms of payment abroad. Check the appropriate\nInternational USCIS office\nwebpage or contact the\nU.S. Embassy or Consulate\nfor information on how to pay USCIS fees.\nIf you are inside the United States\nDepending on the form you are submitting, you may pay your fees:\nOnline using a card or bank withdrawal; or\nBy mail with a card, check, bank draft, or money order.\nWhen filing\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Record\n, directly with a USCIS field office to request emergency advance parole, you may pay only by card, personal check, or business check. Refer to the USCIS\nEmergency Travel\npage for more information.\nFor more information on filing your specific form, go to the USCIS\nAll Forms\npage. Please see our\nNews\npage for the latest updates.\nMultiple Applications or Methods of Payment\nIf you are submitting\nmultiple forms\n, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms. For example, when filing\nForm I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status\n;\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n; and/or\nForm I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition\n, together with a\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\n, you must provide separate payments for each form. If you combine the payments for these forms, we may reject the entire package.\nYou must pay for\neach\napplication, petition, or request you submit using a\nsingle payment method\n(check, bank draft, money order, or card) and not a combination of payment methods. For example, if you file\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, you cannot pay for half the fee with a personal check and half the fee with credit card.\nPay with a Check\nYou may pay fees with bank drafts, cashier’s checks, certified checks, personal or business checks (made payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security), and money orders that are drawn on U.S. financial institutions and payable in U.S. funds. If filing Form I-131 directly with a domestic USCIS field office to request emergency advance parole, you can only pay by personal or business check (or card).\nYou must mail your check, bank draft, or money order together with your benefit request form. Refer to the form instructions for more information. Please see our\nNews\npage for the latest updates.\nIf you are paying your fees by check, please be aware of the following:\nAuthorization for an Electronic Funds Transfer\n: By submitting your check, you authorize us to convert your check into an electronic fund transfer. We will use the account information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer from your checking account for the amount of the check. If the transfer cannot occur for technical reasons, you authorize us to process the copy of your original check through normal paper check procedures.\nInsufficient Funds\n: The electronic fund transfer from your account can occur faster than normal processing for a paper check. If your check or other financial instrument is returned as unpayable, we will resubmit the payment one time. If it is returned as unpayable a second time, we will reject your filing.\nIf your check is not dated within the previous 365 days, we will reject the filing.\nHow to Write Your Check\nPersonal checks must be preprinted with your name and your bank’s name. Your address and phone number must be preprinted, typed, or written in ink.\nWrite the date you are completing the check. Use the U.S. style of month/day/year. (Example: Jan. 4, 2017, or 1/4/17, but not 4/1/17 or 4 JAN 2017.)\nOn the “Pay to the Order of” line, write “U.S. Department of Homeland Security” (not “USDHS” or “DHS”).\nUse numerals to show the exact dollar amount of the fee for the service you are requesting. In the example, the amount is “$760.00.”\nSpell out the exact dollar amount of the fee and write the “cents” portion of the amount as a fraction over 100. In this example, the amount is “Seven hundred sixty and 00/100.”\nWrite a brief description of the purpose of your payment. In this example, it is “N-400 application.” Include the applicant’s name on the memo line if it is not on the check itself (for example, if you are paying the fee for your child).\nSign the check in ink using your legal name.\nIf your check is not dated within the previous 365 days, we will reject the filing.\nPay with a Credit or Debit Card\nIf paying by credit or debit card, you must pay each filing fee separately for each application, petition, or request you submit.\nYou may pay filing and any other applicable fees with a credit or debit card issued by a U.S. bank if you are filing:\nAn application, petition, or request with a\nUSCIS lockbox\n; or\nAn application, petition, or request with the USCIS service centers.\nThere is no additional cost if you pay by credit or debit card. We cannot accept a credit or debit card issued by a foreign bank.\nAcceptable Credit or Debit Cards\nYou may use Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and prepaid cards from the same card networks. Make sure the card’s credit limit can cover the fee. We will reject your application, petition, or request if the card is declined, and we will not attempt to process your credit card payment a second time.\nWe do\nnot\nsupport payment by\ngift cards\n.\nHow to Pay with a Card When Filing by Mail\nTo pay with a card, follow these two steps:\nComplete and sign\nForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions\n.\nPlace the form on top of your application, petition, or request when you file it.\nWhen filing Form G-1450 with a Lockbox or Service Center, you may split the payment for\none form\nacross multiple credit, debit, or prepaid cards that add up the correct total. Complete one Form G-1450 for each card. However, you may use only one Form G-1450 when requesting emergency advance parole from a USCIS field Office. In all cases, the credit, debit, or prepaid card must be from a financial institution located in the United States.\nIf we accept your filing, we will charge your card for the proper amount and destroy your Form G-1450 to protect your card information. (We will destroy it even if we reject your filing and do not process your payment.)\nYou will see a charge from USCIS on your credit card statement.\nThere is a daily transaction limit for credit cards of $24,999.99 per credit card per day set by the Department of the Treasury. We allow an exemption to this limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card.\nSecurity\nWe use the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Pay.gov Trusted Collections Service to process your credit card payment. Trusted Collections Service is a web-based application that allows government agencies to process debit or credit card payments. You cannot pay the fee directly to Pay.gov.\nThe Department of the Treasury ensures that Pay.gov is\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard\ncompliant. This security standard is a set of requirements designed to ensure all companies processing, storing, or transmitting credit card information maintain a secure environment.\nFor your security, we will destroy your Form G-1450 after processing it, regardless of whether we accept or reject your application, petition, or request.\nThird-Party Payments\nAnyone authorized to use a credit card may pay for your application, petition, or request. The cardholder must complete Form G-1450, sign it, and give it to you to submit with your filing.\nDeclined Credit Cards\nIf a credit card is declined, we will not attempt to process the credit card payment again. We will reject your application, petition, or request for lack of payment.\nRejection Notices\nIf we reject your filing, we will send you a notice explaining why we rejected it.\nIf you file a corrected application, petition, or request, and wish to pay again by credit card, you will need to include a new Form G-1450.\nAvoid Immigration Scams\nLearn how to protect yourself from common immigration services scams, and where to report suspected fraud, at\nAvoid Scams\n.\nAnd remember, the current versions of all USCIS forms are always available for free at\nuscis.gov/forms\n.\nIf You File Online\nIf you\nfile your form online\n, the system will guide you through the process of paying your fees with a credit, debit, or prepaid card. Bank account withdrawals are also available when paying online. Once you are ready to submit your form, the system will automatically direct you to the secure Department of the Treasury site, pay.gov, to pay your fees online.\nWe only use pay.gov to process fees. Always check the website address before you pay. Beware of scam websites and scammers who may pretend to be a USCIS website.\nIf You File by Mail\nIf you mail your form to a USCIS Lockbox facility, you may\npay your fees with a debit, credit, or prepaid card\n. To do so, follow these steps:\nComplete and sign\nForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions\n.\nPlace the form on top of your application, petition, or request.\nMail the entire package to the appropriate USCIS Lockbox.\nIf we accept your filing, we will:\nCharge your card for the proper amount; and\nDestroy your Form G-1450 to protect your credit information (we will destroy it even if we reject your filing and do not process your payment).\nYou will see a charge from USCIS on your card statement.\nFor general filing information, see the\nForm Filing Tips\nwebpage.\nUnfunded or Dishonored Payments\nIf we approve your petition, application, or request and the payment has not been properly funded or you subsequently dispute payment of the fee, we may revoke, rescind, or cancel the approval with notice (for example, by issuing a Notice of Intent to Revoke). We will not separately bill you for the unpaid fee. If you receive a Notice of Intent to Revoke, you may respond with payment of the correct fee amount.\nRefund Policy\nWhen you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing and biometric service fees are final and nonrefundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. Please refer to the form you filed for additional information, or you may call the\nUSCIS Contact Center\nat 800-375-5283 (for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833).\nFee Waiver Guidance\nWe are funded largely by application and petition fees. Recognizing that some applicants cannot pay the filing fees, we established a fee waiver process for certain forms and benefit types. We will approve a fee waiver only if you clearly demonstrate that you are unable to pay the filing fees. We carefully consider the merits of each fee waiver request before making a decision.

The fees would be required if the beneficiary has been outside of the United States for more than one year and the petitioner is requesting a “new” initial grant of H-1B or L-1 nonimmigrant status, or if the petitioner is filing to employ the beneficiary in a different nonimmigrant classification than the one obtained previously. For example, filing a petition to change a beneficiary’s nonimmigrant status from L-1 to H-1B.\nPetitioners who request revocation of a petition because the beneficiary who held H-1B or L-1 status left that employer before the expiration date of his or her status do not need to pay the these fees if the petitioner re-files for the same beneficiary at a later date and the petitioner is not requesting a “new” initial grant of the same status.\nPaying the Asylum Program Fee\nThe Asylum Program Fee applies to all Form I-129 visa classifications. The table below explains a petitioner’s Asylum Program Fee obligation.\nType of Petitioner\nAsylum Program Fee\nEntities with more than 25 full-time equivalent employees\n$600\nSmall Entities with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees\n$300\nNonprofit Entities\n$0\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n04/01/2024\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.
