      "content": "International Travel as a Permanent Resident\nWhat documents do I need to travel outside the United States?\nIn general, you will need to present a passport from your country of citizenship or your refugee travel document to travel to a foreign country. In addition, the foreign country may have additional entry/exit requirements (such as a visa). For information on foreign entry and exit requirements, see the\nDepartment of State’s website\n.\nWhat documents do I need to present to reenter the United States?\nIf seeking to enter the United States after temporary travel abroad, you will need to present a valid, unexpired “Green Card” (Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card). When arriving at a port of entry, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer will review your permanent resident card and any other identity documents you present, such as a passport, foreign national I.D. card or U.S. Driver’s License, and determine if you can enter the United States. For information pertaining to entry into the United States, see\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection’s webpage\n.\nDoes travel outside the United States affect my permanent resident status?\nPermanent residents are free to travel outside the United States, and temporary or brief travel usually does not affect your permanent resident status. If it is determined, however, that you did not intend to make the United States your permanent home, you will be found to have abandoned your permanent resident status. A general guide used is whether you have been absent from the United States for more than a year. Abandonment may be found to occur in trips of less than a year where it is believed you did not intend to make the United States your permanent residence. While brief trips abroad generally are not problematic, the officer may consider criteria such as whether your intention was to visit abroad only temporarily, whether you maintained U.S. family and community ties, maintained U.S employment, filed U.S. income taxes as a resident, or otherwise established your intention to return to the United States as your permanent home. Other factors that may be considered include whether you maintained a U.S. mailing address, kept U.S. bank accounts and a valid U.S. driver’s license, own property or run a business in the United States, or any other evidence that supports the temporary nature of your absence.\nWhat if my trip abroad will last longer than 1 year?\nIf you plan on being absent from the United States for longer than a year, it is advisable to first apply for a reentry permit on\nForm I-131\n. Obtaining a reentry permit prior to leaving the United States allows a permanent or conditional permanent resident to apply for admission into the United States during the permit’s validity without the need to obtain a returning resident visa from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad. Please note that it does not guarantee entry into the United States upon your return as you must first be determined to be admissible; however, it will assist you in establishing your intention to permanently reside in the United States. For more information, see the\nTravel Documents\npage.\nIf you remain outside of the United States for more than 2 years, any reentry permit granted before your departure from the United States will have expired. In this case, it is advisable to consider applying for a returning resident visa (SB-1) at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. An SB-1 applicant will be required to establish eligibility for an immigrant visa and will need a medical exam. There is an exception to this process for the spouse or child of either a member of the U.S. Armed Forces or civilian employee of the U.S. Government stationed abroad on official orders. For more information on obtaining a returning resident visa, see the\nDepartment of State’s webpage on returning resident visas\n.\nAdditionally, absences from the United States of six months or more may disrupt the continuous residency required for naturalization. If your absence is one year or longer and you wish to preserve your continuous residency in the United States for naturalization purposes, you may file an Application to Preserve Residence for Naturalization Purposes on Form N-470. For more information, please see the\nContinuous Residence and Physical Presence Requirements\npage.\nWhat if I lose my Green Card or reentry permit or it is stolen or destroyed while I am temporarily traveling outside of the United States?\nIf you lose your Green Card or reentry permit or it is stolen or destroyed while you are abroad, you may need to file a\nForm I-131A, Application for Travel Document (Carrier Documentation)\n. This carrier documentation will allow an airline or other transportation carrier to board a lawful permanent resident bound for the United States without the carrier being penalized. For more information, please see the\nForm I-131A, Application for Travel Document (Carrier Documentation)\npage.\nRelated Links\nMore Information\nWelcome to the United States: A Guide for New Immigrants\nForms\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\nI-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card\nOther USCIS Links\nGreen Card Resources\n\"How Do I\" Guides for Permanent Residents\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n09/12/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.
