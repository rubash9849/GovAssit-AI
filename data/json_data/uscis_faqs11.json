          "answer": "The following information addresses common questions by individuals in H-1B nonimmigrant status, particularly related to applying for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status, job changes or terminations, international travel, and dependent family members. For example, did you know: The chart below summarizes some common scenarios for H-1B workers. The information in this chart is general and does not capture all relevant details or considerations. Please review the FAQs further below and accompanying links for more specific information. Q. I am currently in the United States in another nonimmigrant status. Do I have to depart the United States to obtain H-1B nonimmigrant status? A. Nonimmigrants in the United States who wish to obtain a different nonimmigrant status generally either apply for a change of status with USCIS or, after USCIS approves their benefit request, consular process by applying for a visa in the new classification at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then requesting admission to the United States in the new classification. In general, you may change to H-1B nonimmigrant status without departing the United States. An employer who files an H-1B petition on your behalf can request a change of status on theForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. To be eligible to change your status, you must have been lawfully admitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant, your nonimmigrant status must remain valid, you must not have violated the conditions of your status, and you must not have committed any act that would make you ineligible to receive a nonimmigrant benefit. Also, certain nonimmigrant categories are ineligible for a change of status (seeChange My Nonimmigrant Statusfor a list). If you need to depart the United States – for example, if your current nonimmigrant status expires before your employer is able to file Form I-129 requesting a change of status to H-1B classification – you would generally need to apply for and obtain an H-1B visa stamp from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and present yourself at a port of entry for admission in H-1B status with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) after the approval of the H-1B petition filed on your behalf. SeeRequirements to Timely File a Request to Extend Stay or Change Statusin theUSCIS Policy Manual. Q. How long may I remain in the United States in H-1B status? A. The maximum period of admission for H-1B workers is generally 6 years. However, as detailed below, there are some common exceptions to this limit. Q. When and how long can I extend my H-1B status beyond 6 years? A. Your employer may submitForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, on your behalf, requesting an H-1B extension beyond 6 years in certain scenarios. For example, your employer may request to extend your H-1B status beyond 6 years if at least 365 days have passed since apermanent labor certificationwas filed on your behalf with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) or since an immigrant visa petition (typically Form I-140), enabling you to apply for lawful permanent residence once a visa is available, was filed on your behalf with USCIS under one of theemployment-based immigrant visa categories. We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 1-year increments. More commonly, your employer may also request to extend H-1B status beyond 6 years if you are the beneficiary of anapprovedForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, in thefirst, second, or third preference categoryand are eligible to be granted lawful permanent resident status, except for the fact that an immigrant visa is not available, as reflected in theU.S. Department of State Visa Bulletin. Your petitioning employer must demonstrate that the visa is not available as of the date the H-1B extension petition is filed with USCIS,as determined by your Form I-140 priority date and the relevant visa bulletin chart from the time of filing the H-1B extension request. See theUSCIS Policy Manualfor additional information on visa availability. We may grant extensions on this basis in up to 3-year increments. Additional information about extending H-1B status beyond 6 years, including specific requirements and points at which you are no longer eligible for such extensions, is available on ourH-1B Specialty Occupationspage under “Period of Stay.” Q. Must I presently hold H-1B status to request H-1B status beyond 6 years? A. You do not have to hold H-1B status at the time you request H-1B status beyond the sixth year. Regulations authorizing H-1B status beyond 6 years apply to individuals who are currently inor previously heldH-1B status. For example, imagine you previously held H-1B status for 6 years but had no basis to timely extend beyond 6 years before your 6 years in H-1B status were reached. You then changed to O-1 status. While in O-1 status, a Form I-140 petition in the first, second, or third preference category was approved on your behalf, but an immigrant visa is not available in the ca"

      "last_updated": "10/8/2024)Q. What information is available regarding how many pending Forms I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, USCIS currently has in its inventory in the employment-based categories by country of chargeability?A. We publish an inventory report, Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status - Pending Applications for Employment-Based Preference Categories, intended to provide information about the number of pending Forms I-485 in the employment-based preference categories. The report provides our estimate of how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory for each employment-based preference category, by selected country of chargeability, and by the month and year of the estimated priority date. An alien with a pending adjustment of status application can use the report to estimate how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory with earlier priority dates for their employment-based preference category and country of chargeability. Wait times for an employment-based immigrant visa depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, supply of visas and demand of visas for a particular preference category (at USCIS and the Department of State (DOS)), priority date, the country to which a visa will be charged (usually an applicant’s country of birth), and statutory limitations (for example, per country caps). The report does not include all those who may eventually be eligible for employment-based immigrant visas.  How to Read This Report:This report provides an overview of the estimated volume of pending adjustment of status applications in the employment-based preference categories currently in the USCIS inventory. To determine how many adjustment of status applications in a particular category and country of chargeability have a priority date earlier than a given priority date, first find the sheet in the report with the relevant country of chargeability. Next, determine the relevant “Preference Category” and find the month and year of the priority date to see the volume of pending adjustment of status applications before that preference category and priority date. Every application on the report with a priority date that is earlier than the given priority date is ahead in the queue for adjustment of status. Please note, however, that this report does not contain information about DOS inventory, nor does it have any information about aliens with pending or approved immigrant visa petitions who have not yet applied for adjustment of status. Note also that this report reflects an estimate based on data available at the time the report was generated. The number of pending applications with older priority dates may change, not only as visas become available and applications are approved but also because of other factors, such as new Form I-485 applications based on older priority dates due to priority date retention or applications transferring from one basis to another (for example, an application transferring from a Form I-140 in the EB-3 category to a Form I-140 in the EB-2 category). This report also contains no information about pending applications for permanent labor certifications or prevailing wage determination requests at the Department of Labor. Therefore, it does not provide a complete picture of those in the queue for employment-based immigrant visas. (Added 05/14/2024)  Q. How many employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and the Department of State (DOS) use during FY 2023?A. DOS determined that the FY 2023 employment-based annual limit was 197,091, due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2022 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2023. In addition, 6,396 EB-5 visas carried over from FY 2022 to FY 2023 in the reserved subcategories. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2023, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 10,874 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 147,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States. (Updated 03/07/2024)Q. Can the quarterly reports issued by USCIS or DHS be used to determine quarterly employment-based visa use?A. No. Our Immigration and Citizenship Data “All USCIS Application and Petition Form Types” and “Application for Adjustment of Status (Form I-485)” quarterly reports do not provide a comprehensive picture of employment-based visa use. The quarterly reports do not include the visas issued by our partners at DOS, and before FY 2023 they included the 4th preference employment-based categories under “other.” The quarterly “Legal Immigration and Adjustment of Status” reports published by the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics include adjustments of status but capture immigrant admissions at ports of entry rather than immigrant visa issuance by DOS, and as a result do not reflect year-to-date visa use. Neither report can be used to determine the number of employment-based immigrant visas used during a quarter. Also, USCIS reminds the public that, as noted in the Monthly Immigrant Visa Issuance Statistics reports webpage published by DOS, “individual monthly issuance reports should not be aggregated, as this will not provide an accurate issuance total for the fiscal year to date.” (Updated 10/8/2024)Q. How many family-sponsored or employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and DOS use during FY 2022?A. The Department of State (DOS) determined that the FY 2022 employment-based annual limit was 281,507 – more than double the typical annual total – due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2021 being allocated to the next fiscal year’s available employment-based visas. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 6,396 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year. Of these, USCIS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) approved more than 220,000 employment-based adjustment of status applications for people already present in the United States.DOS determined that the FY 2022 family-sponsored annual limit was 226,000. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2022, the agencies had used 168,917 of the available visas. Of these, USCIS and EOIR approved more than 12,000 family-sponsored adjustment of status applications for individuals already present in the United States. The approximately 57,000 unused family-sponsored visa numbers from FY 2022 are added to the FY 2023 employment-based limit. (Updated 03/22/2023)Q. Would you please summarize the changes we see in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin?A. With the start of fiscal year 2024, DOS can begin allocating employment-based visa numbers from the FY 2024 limit, estimated to be 161,000. As a result, we see a measure of recovery from the retrogressions of FY 2023 in all categories. Every Final Action Date in the Visa Bulletin has advanced from its level in September 2023 (or remained the same), and on Oct. 1, 2023, USCIS and DOS began completing the adjudication of applications filed by aliens for whom visas became available. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. Why have the dates in some categories in the October 2023 Visa Bulletin not advanced sufficiently to allow new applications?A. USCIS and DOS have significant volumes of employment-based adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications in their inventories. For some categories, including EB-2 and EB-3 for aliens chargeable to India, the agencies already have sufficient applications on hand to use up all of the available visas for FY 2024 and several fiscal years in the future. INA 203 requires that DOS make “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year…and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” In addition, INA 245 requires, among other things, an immigrant visa to be “immediately available” at the time an application for adjustment of status is filed. Given these statutory provisions, when the agencies already have enough inventory to use several years’ supply of immigrant visas in a particular category, it is not reasonable to advance the dates in the Visa Bulletin to allow the filing of new applications. (Added 9/15/2023)Q. What does the October 2023 Visa Bulletin reveal about fiscal year 2024 and future fiscal years?A. As the agencies rebuild normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer unused family-based immigrant visa numbers are carrying over to increase the number of available employment-based immigrant visas in FY 2024. In the years ahead, once there are no more unused family-based numbers, the annual number of available employment-based immigrant visas should return to 140,000.This limit, established by Congress more than three decades ago, is insufficient to meet the demand for employment-based immigrant visas in every category. Barring a change to the statute or an unexpected reduction in aliens seeking employment-based immigrant visas, aliens from all countries can expect to see longer waits for immigrant visas.Within EB-1, the category remains “Current” for aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China and the Final Action Dates have advanced for both India and China compared to the September 2023 Visa Bulletin.Within EB-2, demand for visas from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China is so high that for the first time ever, the category is not “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of a fiscal year.The same is true in EB-3, where demand from countries other than India and China is very high and so the category will not be “Current” for such applicants at the beginning of the fiscal year for the first time since FY 2018. The Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to India and China in this category have advanced, reflecting the available visas for FY 2024.As has been true for the past few years, high demand in the EW (Other Worker) category from aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China means that such aliens will still face a significant wait for visa availability.In EB-4, the Final Action Dates for aliens chargeable to all countries has advanced.Visas will continue to be available to all aliens chargeable to countries other than India and China in the EB-5 category. Aliens chargeable to China will continue to benefit from the special statutory exception to the per-country levels in the EB-5 category, and this is reflected by the advancing dates in the Visa Bulletin. The dates for aliens chargeable to India in the EB-5 category have also advanced but the category is not “Current,” reflecting the fact that increased demand in the EB-5 category by such aliens is greater than the available supply of visas. (Added 9/15/2023)Q. With increasingly long waits for employment-based immigrant visas for aliens from every country and in most categories, what has USCIS done to help those affected?A. We are committed to working with Congress to find durable solutions to address the imbalance between the high demand for immigrant visas and the decades-old annual statutory limits. We continue to emphasize that this imbalance needs to be addressed and that only Congress can alleviate the statutory constraint on immigrant visa numbers.At the same time, we continue to pursue policy and regulatory changes to bring greater certainty, stability, and protection for employer-sponsored aliens (as well as self-petitioners, special immigrants and immigrant investors) in the United States. Recent such measures include:Establishing a 5-year validity period for employment authorization documents (EADs)  issued to aliens with pending adjustment of status applications, effective Sept. 27, 2023;Clarifying eligibility criteria for O-1A and O-1B individuals of extraordinary ability;Updating USCIS Policy Manual guidance regarding eligibility for the EB-1 Extraordinary Ability and Outstanding Professor or Researcher visa categories;Clarifying eligibility for EB-2 individuals of exceptional ability and advanced degree holders with national interest waivers;Updating the USCIS interpretation of the Child Status Protection Act to prevent some child beneficiaries from aging out of child status and allowing them to adjust immigration status with their parents;Clarifying the evidence required for physicians seeking a national interest waiver of the job offer requirement;Clarifying eligibility criteria and standards for applications for compelling circumstances employment authorization documents (EADs);Clarifying eligibility for J-1 exchange visitor status;Clarifying options for workers whose employment has terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to remain in the United States while securing new employment;Updating and expanding the list of degree fields qualifying alien graduates of U.S. universities for STEM optional practical training (OPT);Clarifying that USCIS considers certain E-1, E-2, E-3 and L-2 nonimmigrant dependent spouses employment authorized incident to status, such that they are not required to apply and wait for an EAD, and applying the automatic extension of employment authorization for renewal EAD applications filed by these E and L spouses as well as certain H-4 spouses;Establishing a process for healthcare and childcare workers to make an expedited request for processing of initial EAD applications that have been pending for more than 90 days, or renewal applications that would expire within 30 days or have already expired;Expanding premium processing to all filers of Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, and certain filers of Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, while adhering to the congressional requirement that such services must not cause an increase in processing times for regular immigration benefit requests;Launching a new online form for individuals, attorneys, and accredited representatives to request an in-person appointment at their local field office without having to call the USCIS Contact Center. (Updated  12/8/2023)Q. How successful have the agencies been in using the available employment-based visas?A. For every fiscal year since FY 2007, with the exceptions of FY 2020 and FY 2021, USCIS and DOS have either used all of the available employment-based visas or fallen short by less than 1% of the annual limit. The 2-year period between FY 2020-2021 saw significantly higher than usual annual limits, and the shortfall of visa use in these fiscal years was caused by a shortage of financial resources and COVID-19 pandemic-related operational restrictions, which impacted visa processing. Despite these challenges, USCIS approved more employment-based adjustment of status applications in FY 2020 than in any of the previous 6 years. This trend continued through FY 2021, when USCIS approved what was at the time the second highest number of employment-based adjustment of status applications in the history of the agency. As described above, USCIS and DOS utilized all available employment-based immigrant visa numbers in FY 2022 and FY 2023.Q. Did DOS retrogress (set back) certain Final Action Dates or apply new Final Action Dates in the Visa Bulletin for October 2022?A. In the case of the October 2022 Visa Bulletin, without a retrogression of the Final Action Date for India EB-2, visa use by the two agencies would likely have exceeded the available visas within the first few weeks of the fiscal year, in violation of the statute. In setting the first Visa Bulletin of the fiscal year each October, DOS makes reasonable estimates of the available employment-based immigrant visas in each category. It then, in collaboration with USCIS, reviews the pending inventory of adjustment of status and immigrant visa applications, makes reasonable estimates of new applications, estimates how many of the pending and newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during the fiscal year, and compares those values to the available visas.When estimating how many pending or newly filed applications are likely to result in visa use during a fiscal year, the agencies consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to:The potential that a certain percentage of applications will not be approved;Accounting for aliens who have multiple pending adjustment of status applications in different categories;Estimating and considering the number of family members who may decide to immigrate with the principal applicant;Considering where applications are in the adjudication process and how likely they are to result in visa use in the immediate future; andAdjustment of status applicants with multiple pending or approved immigrant visa petitions in different EB categories who may decide to transfer between categories based on which category seems most advantageous to them.When the amount of demand for a particular category (or a country within a category) exceeds the supply of visa numbers available, the category/country is considered “oversubscribed” and DOS applies a cut-off date in the Final Action Dates chart to ensure that visa use remains within the annual limits, as well as the category and per-country limits and order of consideration, as established by Congress. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. Why did DOS retrogress the India EB-3 Final Action Date in the July 2023 Visa Bulletin?A. DOS has answered this question in Item F of the July 2023 Visa Bulletin and in a further clarifying notice at Travel.State.Gov. (Added 06/16/2023)RetrogressionQ. Why do the dates in the Visa Bulletin sometimes retrogress?A. Congress explicitly directs DOS to “make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year within [the family-sponsored, employment-based and diversity categories] and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.” See INA 203(g). DOS makes such estimates, and the Visa Bulletin reflects those “reasonable estimates.” However, these are estimates, and DOS, working collaboratively with USCIS, cannot know exactly how many individuals may ultimately apply for adjustment of status or an immigrant visa or have their applications approved. The demand for visas for adjustment of status depends on the response of aliens to the Visa Bulletin and the demand for immigrant visas depends on the response to the DOS Welcome Letter issued by the National Visa Center. Visa availability for a particular category or country can also change throughout the year through the fall up/fall down provisions (explained in the Allocation of Visa Numbers section on this page), through lower (or higher) use of family-sponsored visas (for example, by aliens chargeable to India or China), and through lower (or higher) than anticipated demand from applicants chargeable to countries other than India or China.This balancing act is a result of Congress allowing DOS to rely on “reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued” while setting very strict and detailed annual limits and rules for the distribution of visas. Congress created a system in which DOS must regularly adjust the population of aliens who can potentially be issued visas (set by the Final Action Dates) in order to create sufficient demand for such visas (allowing the agencies the best chance to use all of the visas) while also restricting the issuance of such visas (to ensure that visa issuance remains within the limits established by Congress).When the demand for visas is higher than estimated and/or the availability of visas is lower than estimated, this may require retrogression of a Final Action Date to ensure that visa use remains within the limits established by Congress and that visas within a particular queue (based on category and country of chargeability) are generally allocated to those with the earliest priority dates as possible. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Why, as DOS noted in Part F of the August 2023 Visa Bulletin, do so many aliens chargeable to India have pending applications in the EB-1 category with older priority dates?A. It is common for aliens to have approved immigrant visa petitions in multiple categories, particularly when an alien faces a significant wait for an available visa. Over time, an alien may develop additional skills or qualifications that make them eligible to be the beneficiary of a petition in one of the EB-1 subcategories. Such aliens may decide to self-petition or have an employer file a petition on their behalf in EB-1, particularly if it would result in becoming an LPR much more quickly than in EB-2 or EB-3 visa categories. Under 8 CFR 204.5(e), an alien who is the beneficiary of multiple approved employment-based petitions in these categories may use the earliest priority date, with some exceptions. Many aliens from India with priority dates in 2012 through 2015 have pursued this option and as a result, the agencies’ pending inventory has a significant volume of such applications. (Added 07/14/2023)Q. Does retrogression affect my priority date or place in line for an immigrant visa?A. If an alien is seeking a visa in a preference category that required a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL), their priority date generally is the date DOL accepts the labor certification application for processing. For all other employment-based preference categories, the priority date generally is the date USCIS accepts the underlying petition for processing. Retrogression does not affect your priority date or your place in line for an immigrant visa. You may still receive a visa when one becomes available to you based on that priority date. Retrogression only means that due to the high demand for visas exceeding the statutory limits, visas are not available to all aliens who want them, even if they have already filed an application for adjustment of status.Q. My category retrogressed or a Final Action Date was applied. What is my path forward to a Green Card?A. When a visa becomes available to you in the future based on the Final Action Date for your country and category as compared to your priority date, USCIS will be able to approve your adjustment of status application if you are admissible, merit a favorable exercise of discretion, and are otherwise eligible. While your I-485 application for adjustment of status is pending, you are eligible to seek certain benefits, among which are:You may apply for employment authorization, which, if granted, is not tied to a particular employer, position, or job classification, and is currently granted in increments of up to 5 years;You may apply for advance parole, which, if granted, authorizes you to travel outside of the United States during the advance parole validity period (also now 5 years) and apply for parole into the United States upon your return (at a U.S. port of entry) without abandoning your adjustment of status application;If your employment-based adjustment of status application has been pending with USCIS for 180 days or more, you may request to “port” the underlying job opportunity upon which your adjustment is based to a new employer or new job offer that is the same or similar to the original one without the portability request alone impacting your priority date;Depending on the facts of your case, your children who have also applied for adjustment of status as your derivative beneficiaries might not age out of eligibility to adjust status as your derivative beneficiaries; andYou are generally considered to be “in a period of stay authorized” while your application is pending and would not accrue unlawful presence while “in a period of authorized stay.”Please note that USCIS is making every effort to reduce processing times for employment authorization and advance parole applications. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. If my adjustment of status application was approved, but then the Final Action Date for my category and country of chargeability later retrogresses, does that affect my status as a lawful permanent resident?A. Retrogression has no effect on lawful permanent residents. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Does retrogression affect consular processing?A. Yes. DOS and USCIS are only authorized to issue immigrant visa numbers (for purposes of consular processing or adjustment of status) if the applicant in the given family-sponsored or employment-based preference category has a priority date that is earlier than the date shown in the Final Action Dates chart of the Visa Bulletin for their country of chargeability and immigrant visa category (or the Visa Bulletin shows that the category is current, that is, visa numbers are authorized for issuance to all qualified applicants). (Added 10/26/2022)Q. How does retrogression of the Final Action Dates affect eligibility for exemption from the 6-year limit on H-1B status?A. Under INA 214(g)(4), the period of “authorized admission” as an H-1B nonimmigrant “may not exceed 6 years.” However, there are certain exemptions to this limitation, including the exemption established by Congress in section 104(c) of the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act  (PDF) and codified in regulation in 8 CFR 214.2(h)(13)(iii)(E). Under that exemption, USCIS may grant additional periods in H-1B status in increments of up to 3 years for an alien who currently maintains or previously held H-1B status, who is the beneficiary of an approved EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 immigrant visa petition, and who is eligible to be granted lawful permanent resident (LPR) status (also known as obtaining a Green Card) in one of those categories but for the application of the per country limitation. If an applicant for adjustment of status is otherwise eligible for the exemption and does not have an immigrant visa available to them in EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 due to the application of the per-country limitations of INA 202(a)(2), USCIS may grant additional periods in H-1B status in increments of up to 3 years. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Does retrogression, the issuance of a Request for Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny, or the scheduling of an interview reset the 180-day portability clock?A. No. For more information about portability, please see Volume 7, Part E, Chapter 5 of the USCIS Policy Manual. (Added 10/26/2022)Q. Do biometrics “expire” due to retrogression?A. No, the biometrics collected by USCIS in connection with a pending adjustment of status application never “expire.” While biometrics-based background checks are valid for a period of 15 months, USCIS refreshes the background check associated with the pending adjustment of status application by resubmitting the previously provided biometrics; a new biometrics appointment is not required. (Added 10/26/2022)Allocation of Visa NumbersQ. How are unused family-sponsored visa numbers from the previous fiscal year that are added to the employment-based limit in the current fiscal year distributed, given the per-country limits?A. Under INA 201(d)(2), the unused family-sponsored visa numbers from the previous fiscal year are added to the overall employment-based limit. Under INA 203(b), that overall employment-based limit is then divided between the 5 employment-based preference categories based on the fixed percentages as described above. However, within each employment-based category, the visas are still distributed with the per-country limits in effect, unless the exception to the per country limits of INA 202(a)(5) applies within that category. This exception is explained in detail in this section of the FAQ. The unused family-sponsored visa numbers added to the employment-based limit in the subsequent fiscal year are not automatically distributed to applicants with the earliest priority dates because the per-country limits still apply. (Updated 12/8/2023)Q. If a category/country is “Current” in the Visa Bulletin, does that mean that there must be little or no inventory of pending applications with USCIS and DOS for that category/country?A. No. A category can be “Current” in the Visa Bulletin even when there are tens of thousands of applications pending with the agencies. “If there are sufficient [remaining visa] numbers in a particular category to satisfy all reported documentarily qualified demand, the category is considered ‘Current.’” See DOS’s The Operation of the Immigrant Numerical Control System  (PDF). For example, if EB-2 has 49,000 visas available for applicants from countries other than India and China, and there are 48,000 pending applications, then the category can be “Current.” (Added 10/26/2022)Q. If visas are “not required” in a particular employment-based category, are they made available in the other employment-based categories?A. Congress has established statutory provisions that allow for the flow of visas “not required” in certain employment-based categories to be made available to applicants in other employment-based categories. These are commonly referred to as the “fall up/fall down” provisions. Under INA 203(b), visas not required in EB-4 and unreserved visas not required in EB-5 are made available in EB-1. Visas not required in EB-1 are made available in EB-2, and visas not required in EB-2 are made available in EB-3. Congress did not create a pathway in the statute for visas not required in EB-3 to be made available in another employment-based category. Please note that with the enactment of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 on March 15, 2022, Congress established special rules for the carryover of certain unused EB-5 visas from one fiscal year to the next. As a result, not all EB-5 visas that are “not required” in that category can be made available in EB-1. DOS, in collaboration with USCIS, considers every month if visas may be “not required” in a particular employment-based category based on reasonable estimates, and sets the dates in the Visa Bulletin accordingly. This can happen as early as the first month in a fiscal year, depending on the underlying data. For example, in FY 2021 it was clear from the beginning of the fiscal year that a significant number of visas would not be “required” in EB-1 and the dates for EB-2 in the October 2020 Visa Bulletin reflected the reasonable estimate that visas would “fall down” to EB-2. As another example, in early FY 2022 it was clear that a significant number of visas would “fall up” from EB-5 to EB-1, and “fall down” from EB-1 to EB-2, and the dates in the Visa Bulletin reflected these reasonable estimates. Below is a visual representation of the “fall up/fall down” provisions. (Updated 03/22/2023)",

          "answer": "The employment-based (EB) annual limit for fiscal year (FY) 2025 will be higher than was typical before the pandemic, though lower than in FY 2021-2024. We are dedicated to using as many availableemployment-based visasas possible in FY 2025, which ends on Sept. 30, 2025. Q. Can you estimate how many employment-based immigrant visas USCIS and the Department of State (DOS) used during FY 2024? A. DOS determined that the FY 2024 employment-based annual limit was 160,791, due to unused family-sponsored visa numbers from FY 2023 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2024. In addition to the 160,791 overall limit, there were 10,874  visas available in the EB-5 category that Congress allowed to carry over from the previous 2 fiscal years. Preliminary estimates indicate that the agencies used all the employment-based immigrant visas, apart from approximately 7,700 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over within the EB-5 category for the next fiscal year.(Updated 10/8/2024) Q.What information is available regarding how many pending Forms I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, USCIS currently has in its inventory in the employment-based categories by country of chargeability? A. We publish an inventory report,Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status - Pending Applications for Employment-Based Preference Categories, intended to provide information about the number of pending Forms I-485 in the employment-based preference categories. The report provides our estimate of how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory for each employment-based preference category, by selected country of chargeability, and by the month and year of the estimated priority date. An alien with a pending adjustment of status application can use the report to estimate how many Forms I-485 we have in our inventory with earlier priority dates for their employment-based preference category and country of chargeability. Wait times for an employment-based immigrant visa depend on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, supply of visas and demand of visas for a particular preference category (at USCIS and the Department of State (DOS)), priority date, the country to which a visa will be charged (usually an applicant’s country of birth), and statutory limitations (for example, per country caps). The report does not include all those who may eventually be eligible for employment-based immigrant visas. How to Read This Report: This report provides an overview of the estimated volume of pending adjustment of status applications in the employment-based preference categories currently in the USCIS inventory. To determine how many adjustment of status applications in a particular category and country of chargeability have a priority date earlier than a given priority date, first find the sheet in the report with the relevant country of chargeability. Next, determine the relevant “Preference Category” and find the month and year of the priority date to see the volume of pending adjustment of status applications before that preference category and priority date. Every application on the report with a priority date that is earlier than the given priority date is ahead in the queue for adjustment of status. Please note, however, that this report does not contain information about DOS inventory, nor does it have any information about aliens with pending or approved immigrant visa petitions who have not yet applied for adjustment of status. Note also that this report reflects an estimate based on data available at the time the report was generated. The number of pending applications with older priority dates may change, not only as visas become available and applications are approved but also because of other factors, such as new Form I-485 applications based on older priority dates due to priority date retention or applications transferring from one basis to another (for example, an application transferring from a Form I-140 in the EB-3 category to a Form I-140 in the EB-2 category). This report also contains no information about pending applications for permanent labor certifications or prevailing wage determination requests at the Department of Labor. Therefore, it does not provide a complete picture of those in the queue for employment-based immigrant visas. (Added 05/14/2024) Q. How many employment-based immigrant visas did USCIS and the Department of State (DOS) use during FY 2023? A. DOS determined that the FY 2023 employment-based annual limit was 197,091, due to unused family-based visa numbers from FY 2022 being added to the employment-based limit for FY 2023. In addition, 6,396 EB-5 visas carried over from FY 2022 to FY 2023 in the reserved subcategories. By the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2023, the agencies used all of these employment-based immigrant visas, apart from 10,874 EB-5 visas that Congress has allowed to carry over to the next fiscal year.

Therefore, if you called a customer service representative to change your address, please be sure you also change your address online or with a Form AR-11.Denied the request on the grounds that you did not come to the United States before your 16th birthday, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you did arrive before reaching that age.Denied the request on the grounds that you were under age 15 at the time of filing but not in removal proceedings, while the evidence submitted at the time of filing show that you indeed were in removal proceedings when the request was filed;Denied the request on the grounds that you were 31 or older as of June 15, 2012, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012;Denied the request on the grounds that you had lawful status on June 15, 2012, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you indeed were in an unlawful immigration status on that date;Denied the request on the grounds that you were not physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and up through the date of filing, but the evidence submitted at the time of filing shows that you were, in fact, present;Denied on the grounds that you are not currently in school, have not graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have not obtained a GED certificate, and are not an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States;Denied the request due to your failure to appear at a USCIS ASC where we may collect your biometrics, when you in fact either did appear at a USCIS ASC to have this done or requested before the scheduled date of your biometrics appointment to have the appointment rescheduled; orDenied the request because you did not pay the filing fees for Form I-821D or Form I-765 when you actually did pay these fees.Q28: If USCIS does not exercise deferred action in my case, will I be placed in removal proceedings?A28: If we deny your request for DACA under 8 CFR 236.23, we will not issue a Notice to Appear or refer your case to ICE for possible enforcement action based on our denial, unless we determine that your case involves denial for a criminal offense, fraud, a threat to national security, or public safety concerns. We may consider factors including, but not limited to, whether a misrepresentation is willful, material, and knowing in determining whether fraud is involved in a case.Q29: Can USCIS terminate my DACA before it expires?A29: Yes. DACA is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and under 8 CFR 236.23(d), we may terminate a grant of DACA at any time, at USCIS’ discretion. We will provide a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT) and an opportunity to respond before terminating a DACA grant, except we may terminate a grant of DACA without an NOIT and an opportunity to respond if you are convicted of a national security-related offense involving conduct described in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), (iv), or 1227(a)(4)(A)(i)), or an egregious public safety offense. If we terminate your grant of DACA without an NOIT and an opportunity to respond, we will notify you of the termination.Q30: What happens to my employment authorization if USCIS terminates my DACA before it expires?A30: A grant of employment authorization based on DACA, under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33), will automatically terminate when DACA terminates. See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(3).Return to top.II. Initial Requests for DACAQ31: What guidelines must I meet to be considered for DACA?A31: Under current court orders, we are accepting, but not adjudicating, initial requests for DACA. Under 8 CFR 236.22, to be considered for DACA you must submit evidence, including supporting documents, showing that you:Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981);Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up until you filed your request for DACA;Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and when you filed your request for DACA with USCIS;Had no lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012,* and when you filed your request for DACA, meaning that:You never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012, orAny lawful immigration status or parole that you had before June 15, 2012, expired as of June 15, 2012, andAny lawful status that you had after June 15, 2012, expired or otherwise ended before you submitted your request for DACA;Are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.We consider on a case-by-case basis deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Even if you meet the threshold criteria listed above and at 8 CFR 236.22(b), we retain the discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that any specific factor makes deferred action inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22(c).* Please review Q19 if you are currently in a lawful immigration status.Q32: I first came to the United States before I turned 16 years old, and I have been continuously residing in the United States since at least June 15, 2007. Before I turned 16 years old, however, I left the United States for some period before returning and beginning my current period of continuous residence. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A32: Yes, but only if you established residence in the United States during the period before you turned 16 years old, as evidenced, for example, by records showing you attended school or worked in the United States during that time, or that you lived in the United States for multiple years during that time. In addition to establishing that you initially resided in the United States before you turned 16 years old, you must also have maintained continuous residence in the United States from June 15, 2007, until the present time to be considered for deferred action under this process. See 8 CFR 236.22(b)(1)-(2).Q33: To prove my continuous residence in the United States since June 15, 2007, must I provide evidence documenting my presence for every day, or every month, of that period?A33: To meet the continuous residence guideline under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(2), you must submit documentation that shows you have been living in the United States from June 15, 2007, up until the time of filing your request. You should provide documentation to account for as much of the period as reasonably possible, but there is no requirement that every day or month of that period be specifically accounted for through direct evidence.It is helpful for us if you can submit evidence of your residence during at least each year of the period. We will review the documentation in its totality to determine whether it is more likely than not that you were continuously residing in the United States for the period since June 15, 2007. Gaps in the documentation for certain periods may raise doubts about your continued residence if they are lengthy or the record otherwise indicates that you may have been outside the United States for a period that was not brief, casual or innocent.If gaps in your documentation raise questions, we may issue a Request for Evidence(RFE) to allow you to submit additional documentation that supports your claimed continuous residence.You may submit affidavits to explain a gap in the documentation showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement. If you submit affidavits related to the continuous residence requirement, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances during the period when there is a gap in the documentation. You may only use affidavits to explain gaps in your continuous residence; you cannot use them as evidence that you meet the entire 5-year continuous residence requirement.Q34: I came to the United States when I was very young and before I began attending school, so I do not have primary evidence of the start of my continuous residence in the United States. Can I submit an affidavit as proof of the start of my continuous residence period?A34: DHS will accept affidavits for the start of the continuous residence period if you are a new initial requestor who arrived in the United States at or before age 8. We recognize that age 8 is the highest age at which school attendance becomes required within the United States, and that it may be more challenging for individuals who arrived before that age to provide primary evidence of the start of their continuous residence period.Q35: Does “currently enrolled in school” refer to the date when I file the request for consideration of deferred action?A35: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in school on the date you submit a DACA request.Q36: Who is considered to be “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A36: To be considered “currently enrolled in school” under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5), you must be enrolled in:A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school, secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements;An education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; orAn education program helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law (including a certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or alternate award), or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) in the United States.Education, literacy, and career training programs (including vocational training), or education programs helping students obtain a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent under state law, or in passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam in the United States, may include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations. Programs funded by other sources may qualify if they have demonstrated effectiveness.In assessing whether programs are of demonstrated effectiveness, we will consider:The duration of the program’s existence;The program’s track record in:Assisting students in obtaining a regular high school diploma or its recognized equivalent;Passing a GED or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC); orPlacing students in postsecondary education, job training, or employment; andOther indicators of the program’s overall quality.If you seek to demonstrate that you are “currently enrolled in school” with your enrollment in such a program, you must show the program’s demonstrated effectiveness.Q37: How do I establish that I am currently enrolled in school?A37: Documentation showing that you are enrolled in school may include evidence that you are enrolled in:A public, private, or charter elementary school, junior high or middle school, high school or secondary school, alternative program, or homeschool program that meets state requirements; orAn education, literacy, or career training program (including vocational training) that:Has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English, or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement; andIs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness; orAn education program assisting students in obtaining a high school equivalency diploma or certificate recognized under state law (such as by passing a GED exam or other state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), and that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations or, if funded by other sources, is of demonstrated effectiveness.Evidence of enrollment may include acceptance letters, school registration cards, letters from a school or program, transcripts, report cards, or progress reports that may show the name of the school or program, date of enrollment, and current educational or grade level, if relevant. See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents.Q38: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school?A38: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation showing that you have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to:A high school diploma from a public or private high school or secondary school; orA certificate of completion, a certificate of attendance, or an alternate award from a public or private high school or secondary school or a recognized equivalent of a high school diploma under state law, or a GED certificate or certificate from passing another such state authorized exam (e.g., HiSet or TASC) in the United States.Q39: What documentation may be sufficient to demonstrate that I have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC)?A39: See Chart #1, below, for examples of documents. Documentation demonstrating that you have obtained a GED certificate or certificate from passing a similar state-authorized exam for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) may include, but is not limited to, evidence that you have passed a GED exam or other state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) and received the recognized equivalent of a regular high school diploma under state law.Q40: If I am enrolled in a literacy or career training program, can I meet the guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A40: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) if you are enrolled in an education, literacy, or career training program that has a purpose of improving literacy, mathematics, or English or is designed to lead to placement in postsecondary education, job training, or employment and where you are working toward such placement. Such programs include, but are not limited to, programs wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or if funded by other sources, are programs of demonstrated effectiveness.Q41: If I am enrolled in an English as a second language (ESL) program, can I meet the guidelines?A41: Yes, in certain circumstances. You may be able to establish that you meet the education criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5) through enrollment in an ESL program if the ESL program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants or administered by nonprofit organizations, or is a program of demonstrated effectiveness. You must submit direct documentary evidence that the program is wholly or partially funded by federal, state, county or municipal grants, administered by a nonprofit organization, or of demonstrated effectiveness.Q42: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5)?A42: No. We will not accept evidence that is not listed in Chart #1 to establish that you are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, or have obtained a GED or passed another state-authorized exam (such as HiSet or TASC) for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5). You must submit any of the documentary evidence listed in Chart #1 to show that you meet the education guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(5).Q43: Will USCIS consider evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to show that I have met certain threshold criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b)?A43: You may use evidence other than those documents listed in Chart #1 to establish that you meet the following guidelines and factual showings, if available documentary evidence is insufficient or lacking and shows that:You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You satisfy the continuous residence requirement, if you present direct evidence of your continued residence in the United States for a portion of the required period and the circumstantial evidence is used only to fill in gaps in the length of continuous residence demonstrated by the direct evidence; andAny travel outside the United States during the period of required continuous presence was brief, casual, and innocent.However, we will not accept evidence other than the documents listed in Chart #1 as proof that you meet any of the following guidelines:You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYou are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a GED certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States.For example, even if you do not have documentary proof of your presence in the United States on June 15, 2012, you may still be able to demonstrate that you meet the guideline. You may do so by submitting credible documentary evidence that you were present in the United States shortly before and shortly after June 15, 2012, which may be enough to infer you were present June 15, 2012, as well. However, we will not accept evidence other than that listed in Chart #1 to establish that you have graduated high school. You must submit the designated documentary evidence to satisfy that you meet this guideline.Chart #1 provides examples of documentation you may submit to demonstrate you meet the threshold criteria for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.

However, you may use affidavits to support meeting the following guidelines if the documentary evidence available to you is insufficient or lacking:Showing that you meet the 5-year continuous residence requirement;Establishing the start of the continuous residence period if you entered the United States before age 8; andEstablishing that departures during the required period of continuous residence were brief, casual, and innocent.If you submit affidavits related to the above criteria, you must submit 2 or more affidavits, sworn to or affirmed by people other than yourself, who have direct personal knowledge of the events and circumstances. If we determine that the affidavits are insufficient to overcome the unavailability or lack of documentary evidence with respect to either of these guidelines, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating you must submit further evidence to demonstrate that you meet these guidelines.We will not accept affidavits to satisfy the following guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b):You are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion or other alternate award from high school, have obtained a high school equivalency diploma or certificate (such as by passing the GED exam or other similar state-authorized exam such as HiSet or TASC), or are an honorably discharged veteran from the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States;You were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012;You came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;You were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981); andYour lack of disqualifying criminal history.If the only evidence you submit to demonstrate you meet any of the above guidelines is an affidavit, we will issue a Request for Evidence, indicating that you have not demonstrated that you meet these guidelines and that you must submit evidence to demonstrate that you meet that guideline.Q45: Can I be considered for deferred action under this process if I had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal pending before either USCIS or the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) on June 15, 2012?A45: Yes. If you had an application for asylum or cancellation of removal, or similar relief, pending before either USCIS or EOIR as of June 15, 2012, but had no lawful status, you may request consideration of DACA.Q46: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I violated my immigration status (for example, by engaging in unauthorized employment, failing to report to my employer, or failing to pursue a full course of study) before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A46: No, unless the Executive Office for Immigration Review terminated your status by issuing a final order of removal against you before June 15, 2012.Q47: I was admitted for \"duration of status\" or for a period that extended past June 14, 2012, but I \"aged out\" of my dependent nonimmigrant status as of June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A47: Yes. For purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,\" guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if you were admitted for duration of status or for a period of time that extended past June 14, 2012, but aged out of your dependent nonimmigrant status on or before June 15, 2012, (meaning you turned 21 years old on or before June 15, 2012), you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q48: I was admitted for duration of status, but my status in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) is listed as terminated on or before June 15, 2012. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A48: Yes. For the purposes of satisfying the “had no lawful status on June 15, 2012,” guideline at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(4) alone, if your status as of June 15, 2012, is listed as “terminated” in SEVIS, you may be considered for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q49: I am a Canadian citizen who was inspected by CBP but was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A49: In general, a Canadian citizen who was admitted as a visitor for business or pleasure and not issued a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record (also known as a “non-controlled” Canadian nonimmigrant) is lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. For that reason, unless there is evidence, including verifiable evidence provided by the individual, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time, DHS will consider, for purposes of 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 only, that the alien was lawfully admitted for a period of 6 months. If DHS can verify from its records that your last noncontrolled entry occurred on or before Dec. 14, 2011, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q50: I used my Border Crossing Card (BCC) to obtain admission to the United States and was not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission. May I be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A50: Because the limitations on entry for a BCC holder vary based on location of admission and travel, DHS will assume that the BCC holder who was not provided a Form I-94 was admitted for the longest period legally possible—30 days—unless the individual can demonstrate, through verifiable evidence, that they were specifically advised that their admission would be for a different length of time. Accordingly, if DHS is able to verify from its records that your last admission was using a BCC, you were not issued a Form I-94 at the time of admission, and it occurred on or before May 14, 2012, DHS will consider your nonimmigrant visitor status to have expired as of June 15, 2012, and you may be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q51: Do I accrue unlawful presence if I have a pending initial request for consideration of DACA?A51: You will continue to accrue unlawful presence while the request for consideration of DACA is pending unless you are under 18 years of age at the time of the request. If you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your request, you will not accrue unlawful presence while the request is pending, even if you turn 18 while your request is pending with USCIS. If we grant your DACA request, you will not accrue unlawful presence during the period of deferred action. However, having deferred action will not excuse previously accrued unlawful presence.Return to top.III. Renewal of DACAQ52: When should I file my DACA renewal request?A52: We strongly encourage you to submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice and EAD. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision.DACA recipients may submit a DACA renewal request online. To file Form I-821D and Form I-765 online, a DACA requestor must first create a USCIS online account, which provides a convenient and secure method to submit forms, pay fees and track the status of any pending USCIS immigration request throughout the adjudication process. There is no cost to set up an account, which offers a variety of features, including the ability to communicate with USCIS through a secure inbox and respond online to Requests for Evidence. For additional information on filing a DACA renewal request online, go to the Form I-821D webpage. All online DACA renewal requests must include Form I-821D, Form I-765, and Form I-765WS and accompanying fees.USCIS’ current goal is to process DACA renewal requests within 120 days. You may submit an inquiry online about the status of your renewal request after it has been pending more than 105 days. Please Note: Factors that may affect the timely processing of your DACA renewal request include, but are not limited to:If you fail to appear at an ASC for a scheduled biometrics appointment to obtain fingerprints and photographs. It will take longer to process your request if you miss or reschedule your appointments;Issues of national security, criminality or public safety discovered during the background check process that require further vetting;Issues of travel abroad that need additional evidence or clarification;Name or date of birth discrepancies that may require additional evidence or clarification; orA renewal submission that is incomplete or contains evidence that suggests a requestor may not satisfy the DACA renewal guidelines and we must request additional evidence or an explanation.Q53: Can I file a renewal request outside the recommended filing period of 120 to 150 days before my current DACA expires?A53: We strongly encourages you to file your renewal request within the recommended 120- to 150-day filing period to minimize the possibility that your current period of DACA will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. We will accept requests we receive earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expires; however, this could result in an overlap between your current DACA and your renewal. This means your renewal period may extend for less than a full 2 years from the date that your current DACA period expires.If you file less than 120 days before your current period of DACA expires, there is more risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. If you file after your most recent DACA period expires, but within 1 year of its expiration, you may submit a request to renew your DACA. If you are filing beyond 1 year after your most recent period of DACA expired, or if your most recent grant of DACA was terminated at any time, you may still request DACA by submitting a new initial request.Please note: An ongoing July 16, 2021, injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and, on Oct. 14, 2022, was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect and prohibits DHS from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule. Due to the partial stay of the injunction, DHS presently may grant DACA renewal requests under the final rule.Q54: How will USCIS evaluate my request for renewal of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A54: We may consider renewing your DACA if you met the guidelines for consideration of Initial DACA (see above and 8 CFR 236.22(b)) and you:Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012;Have continuously resided in the United States since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved up to the present time; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.These guidelines must be met for consideration of DACA renewal. We consider deferred action requests submitted under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 on a case-by-case basis. Even if you meet the guidelines, we have discretion to assess your circumstances and determine that deferred action is inappropriate. See 8 CFR 236.22I.Q55. Do I accrue unlawful presence if I am seeking renewal and my previous period of DACA expires before I receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA? Similarly, what would happen to my work authorization?A55: Yes, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will accrue unlawful presence for any time between the periods of deferred action, unless you are under 18 years of age at the time you submit your renewal request.Similarly, if your previous period of DACA expires before you receive a renewal of deferred action under DACA, you will not be authorized to work in the United States regardless of your age at time of filing until and unless you receive a new EAD from USCIS.Q56. Do I need to provide additional documents when I request renewal of deferred action under DACA?A56. No, unless you have new documents pertaining to removal proceedings or criminal history that you have not already submitted to USCIS in a previously approved DACA request. However, we reserve the authority, at our discretion, to request additional documents, information or statements relating to a DACA renewal request determination.CAUTION: If you knowingly and willfully provide materially false information on Form I-821D, you will be committing a federal felony punishable by a fine, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. In addition, you may be placed into removal proceedings, face severe penalties provided by law, and be subject to criminal prosecution.Q57.; If I am no longer enrolled in school, can I still request to renew my DACA?A57. Yes. Neither Form I-821D nor the instructions ask renewal requestors for information about continued school enrollment or graduation. The instructions for renewal requests specify that you may be considered for DACA renewal if you met the guidelines for consideration of initial DACA, including the educational guidelines and:Did not engage in unauthorized travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without advance parole;Have continuously resided in the United States, up to the present time, since you submitted your most recent request for DACA that was approved; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)or 3 or more other misdemeanors and are not a threat to national security or public safety.Q58. If I initially received DACA and was under age 31 on June 15, 2012, but have since become 31 or older, can I still request renewal of DACA?A58. Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of DACA as long as you were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012. IV. TravelQ59: May I travel outside the United States before I submit an initial DACA request or while my initial DACA request is pending with USCIS?A59: Any unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt your continuous residence, and you will not be considered for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. We will assess any travel outside of the United States that occurred on or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012, to determine whether the travel qualifies as brief, casual and innocent. (See Chart #2.)CAUTION: You should be aware that if you have been ordered deported or removed, and you then leave the United States, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.Q60: As a DACA recipient, can I travel outside of the United States?A60: Not automatically. If you want to travel outside the United States after receiving DACA, you must apply for an advance parole document by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and paying the applicable fee. We will determine whether your purpose for international travel is justifiable based on the circumstances you describe in your request. Generally, we will only issue an advance parole document if you want to travel outside the United States for:Humanitarian purposes, including to obtain medical treatment, attend funeral services for a family member, or visit an ailing relative;Educational purposes, such as semester abroad programs and academic research; orEmployment purposes, including but not limited to overseas assignments, interviews, conferences or training, consular appointment for an employer-sponsored nonimmigrant visa, or meetings with clients overseas.Travel for vacation is not a valid basis for advance parole.Travel for educational purposes means travel affiliated with an institution that provides education as its primary purpose. You do not have to be enrolled in the institution that the program is affiliated with, but you must be enrolled in the program you will be traveling with.You may not apply for an advance parole document unless and until we approve your DACA request. If you are submitting a DACA renewal request, you may apply for advance parole at the same time; however, there is a separate filing address for advance parole requests, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will consider all advance parole requests on a case-by-case basis.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131.If we have granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 after you have been ordered deported or removed, you may still request advance parole if you meet the guidelines for advance parole described above.CAUTION: If you have been ordered deported or removed, before you leave the United States, you should seek to reopen your case before the EOIR and obtain administrative closure or termination of your removal proceeding. Even after you have asked EOIR to reopen your case, you should not leave the United States until after EOIR has granted your request. If you depart after being ordered deported or removed, and your removal proceeding has not been reopened and administratively closed or terminated, you may be considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences. If you have any questions about this process, you may contact ICE through the local ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor with jurisdiction over your case.Q61: What happens to my DACA grant if I leave the United States without advance parole?A61: CAUTION: When you leave the United States, you are no longer in a period of deferred action. DACA recipients who leave the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States. We strongly encourage you to obtain an advance parole document before you leave to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA.We may terminate a grant of DACA, in our discretion and after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond, for DACA recipients who depart from the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document and subsequently enter the United States without inspection. See 8 CFR 236.23(d)(2). Generally, a recent entry without inspection will be a significant negative factor warranting termination of DACA as a threat to border security, but where there are exigent circumstances, such as accidental or involuntary border crossings, DHS may choose to continue exercising prosecutorial discretion and allow the grant of deferred action to continue.DACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining advance parole but who are paroled into the United States may resume their DACA upon expiration of the period of parole.Q62: Why does my advance parole document show a 1-day parole period?A62: Your advance parole document may show a parole period of 1 day because it is to facilitate your reentry into the United States, at which time you will resume your current DACA validity period. This is different from the language on your advance parole document that authorizes a departure and reentry between specified dates. Please review your advance parole document carefully to understand the details of your travel authorization.Q63: Do brief departures from the United States interrupt the continuous residence requirement?A63: A brief, casual, and innocent absence from the United States will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, unauthorized travel outside of the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, will interrupt continuous residence, regardless of whether it was otherwise brief, casual, and innocent. Your absence from the United States will be considered brief, casual, and innocent if it was on or after June 15, 2007, and before Aug. 15, 2012, and:The absence was short and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose for the absence;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of exclusion, deportation, or removal;The absence was not because of a post-June 15, 2007, order of voluntary departure, or an administrative grant of voluntary departure before you were placed in exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings; andThe purpose of the absence and your actions while outside the United States were not contrary to law.Once we have approved your request for DACA, you may file Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States.CAUTION: If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, without authorization and subsequently enter without inspection, DHS will issue you a Notice of Intent to Terminate and may, barring exigent circumstances, terminate your deferred action under DACA in its discretion,Travel Guidelines (Chart #2)Travel DatesType of TravelDoes It Affect Continuous ResidenceOn or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012Brief, casual and innocentNoFor an extended timeBecause of an order of exclusion, deportation, voluntary departure, or removalTo participate in criminal activityYesOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACAAnyYes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case, and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.In addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely mean you are considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.On or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACAAnyOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after receiving DACAAnyIt depends. If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence. However, if you travel without authorization, the travel will interrupt your continuous residence.Q64: May I file a request for advance parole at the same time I file my DACA package?A64: You may file an advance parole request at the same time as a DACA renewal request (but not at the same time as an initial DACA request). However, the filing addresses for a DACA renewal request and an advance parole request are different, and you must send each request to its appropriate filing address. We will not issue an advance parole document for a period that continues past your DACA validity period.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal request between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires. If your current period of DACA has expired when we are adjudicating your Form I-131, and you do not have a pending DACA renewal request, we will deny your Form I-131.To request advance parole, you must submit Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records. Please visit the Form I-131 webpage before you begin the process to make sure you are using the current version of the form. To request advance parole to travel outside the United States, you must complete and sign Form I-131 and include the required filing fee, as listed on the Form I-131 webpage.You can find information on where to file on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-131 webpage under “Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).” If you do not send Form I-131 to the correct address, it may significantly delay adjudication of your application or cause us to deny it.Q65: Will USCIS expedite the processing of a DACA Form I-131 advance parole application currently pending with USCIS?A65: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within the sole discretion of USCIS. Please visit the USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitions for more information and guidance on expedite requests.Q66: What if I am experiencing an extremely urgent situation and have not filed my Form I-131 advance parole application?A66:If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation and need to travel within 90 days, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office by contacting the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment:A completed and signed Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (such as medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); and2 passport-style photos.Return to top.V. Criminal ConvictionsQ67: If I have a conviction for a felony offense, a misdemeanor offense described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or multiple other misdemeanors, can I be granted DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A67: No. If you have been convicted of a felony offense, a misdemeanor offense described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct, we will not consider you for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q68: What offenses qualify as a felony?A68: A felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year.A single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.Q69: What offenses constitute disqualifying misdemeanors (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) for purposes of DACA?A69: For purposes of DACA, a misdemeanor (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) that meets the following criteria:Regardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; orIf not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence.The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE.A single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described above is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.Notwithstanding the above, the decision whether to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of any misdemeanor convictions as described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion.Q70: What offenses constitute “other misdemeanors” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))?A70: For purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), an “other misdemeanor” is any misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater 5 days) that meets the following criteria:Is not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; andIs an offense for which the individual was sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less. The time in custody does not include any time served beyond the sentence for the criminal offense based on a state or local law enforcement agency honoring a detainer issued by ICE.Three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA.The decision to defer action in a particular case is an individualized, discretionary decision that takes into account all the circumstances. The absence of three or more convictions of “other misdemeanors”  is not necessarily determinative, but it is a factor we will consider when we exercise our discretion.A single misdemeanor conviction that is not a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we may consider such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine whether a DACA requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.Q71: If I have a minor traffic offense, such as driving without a license, will it be considered a misdemeanor that counts towards the “3 or more other misdemeanors” and make me unable to receive consideration for an exercise of prosecutorial discretion under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A71: We will not consider a minor traffic offense a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), and it is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. However, we can consider your entire offense history along with other facts to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, you warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion.It is important to emphasize that driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), regardless of the sentence imposed.Q72: What qualifies as a national security or public safety threat?A72: If the background check or other information uncovered during the review of your request for deferred action indicates that your presence in the United States threatens public safety or national security, we will not grant your DACA request. Indicators that you pose such a threat include, but are not limited to, gang membership, participation in criminal activities, or participation in activities that threaten the United States.Q73: Will offenses criminalized as felonies or misdemeanors by state immigration laws be considered disqualifying convictions for purpose of DACA?A73: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), convictions under state laws (including U.S. territories) for immigration-related offenses are not considered convictions for purposes of DACA.Q74: Will USCIS consider my expunged conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication as a disqualifying conviction for purposes of DACA?A74: No. Under 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), we do not consider expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications disqualifying convictions for purposes of DACA. However, we will assess expunged convictions and juvenile delinquency adjudications on a case-by-case basis to determine whether, under the circumstances, you present a national security or public safety concern and a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion is otherwise warranted. If you were a juvenile, but tried and convicted as an adult, we will not consider your conviction a juvenile delinquency adjudication.Return to top.VI. Employment AuthorizationQ75. What should I do if my EAD was lost, stolen, or damaged?A75. If your deferred action under DACA is currently valid, and you do not need to renew it, but you need to replace a valid EAD because yours was lost, stolen, or damaged, file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, and select box 1.b. Submit the properly completed Form I-765, evidence that you are a current DACA recipient (such as your most recent DACA approval notice), and filing fee to the filing address for the location where you live.Do not file Form I-821D, Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, with this Form I-765. If you submit Form I-821D when you are filing to replace a lost, stolen, or damaged EAD, we will deny your Form I-821D and we will not refund the $85 filing fee for Form I-821D.Return to top.VII. MiscellaneousQ76: Can USCIS terminate my DACA grant?A76: DHS may seek to terminate a grant of DACA at any time in its discretion. However, in most cases we will provide DACA recipients with a Notice of Intent to Terminate (NOIT), with an opportunity to respond, before termination. We have discretion to terminate without providing a DACA recipient a NOIT and opportunity to respond if you were convicted of a national security-related offense involving conduct described in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii), 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv), or 1227(a)(4)(A)(i), or an egregious public safety offense.Q77: Does deferred action provide a path to permanent resident status (a Green Card) or citizenship?A77: No. Deferred action is a form of prosecutorial discretion that does not confer lawful permanent resident status or a path to citizenship. Only Congress, acting through its legislative authority, can confer these rights.Q78: Can I be considered for deferred action even if I do not meet the guidelines to be considered for DACA?A78: The process at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is only for individuals who meet the specific guidelines for DACA. Other individuals may, on a case-by-case basis, request deferred action from USCIS or ICE in certain circumstances, consistent with longstanding practice.Q79: How will ICE and USCIS handle cases involving individuals who do not satisfy the guidelines of this process but believe they may otherwise warrant an exercise of prosecutorial discretion?A79: If we find that you do not satisfy the DACA guidelines at 8 CFR 236.22(b) or otherwise determines you do not warrant a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion, then we will decline to defer action in your case. If you are currently in removal proceedings, have a final order, or have a voluntary departure order, you may then request ICE consider whether to exercise prosecutorial discretion. Guidance on requests to ICE for prosecutorial discretion is available at ICE’s Prosecutorial Discretion webpage.Q80: How should I fill out question 9 on Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization?A80. When you are filing a Form I-765 as part of a DACA request, question 9 is asking you to list those Social Security numbers that were officially issued to you by the Social Security Administration.Q81: Is there supervisory review of decisions by USCIS under this process?A81: Yes. We have implemented a successful supervisory review process to ensure a consistent process for considering requests for DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25.Q82: Do USCIS personnel responsible for reviewing requests for DACA receive special training?A82: Yes. USCIS personnel responsible for considering requests for consideration of DACA have received special training.Q83: Must attorneys and accredited representatives who provide pro bono services to deferred action requestors at group assistance events file a Form G-28 with USCIS?A83: Under 8 C.F.R. §§ 292.3 and 1003.102, practitioners are required to file Form G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative, when they engage in practice in immigration matters before DHS, either in person or through the preparation or filing of any brief, application, petition, or other document. Under these rules, a practitioner who consistently violates the requirement to file a Form G-28 may be subject to disciplinary sanctions; however, on Feb. 28, 2011, we issued a statement indicating that we do not intend to initiate disciplinary proceedings against practitioners (attorneys and accredited representatives) based solely on the failure to submit a Form G-28 in relation to pro bono services provided at group assistance events. DHS is in the process of issuing a final rule, at which time this matter will be reevaluated.Q84: When must an individual sign a Form I-821D as a preparer?A84: Anytime someone other than the requestor prepares or helps fill out the Form I-821D, that individual must complete Part 5 of the form.Q85: If I provide my employee with information regarding their employment to support a request for consideration of DACA, will that information be used for immigration enforcement purposes against me or my company?A85: You may, as you determine appropriate, provide individuals requesting DACA with documentation which verifies their employment. This information will not be shared with ICE for civil immigration enforcement purposes under section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (relating to unlawful employment) unless there is evidence of egregious violations of criminal statutes or widespread abuses.Q86: Can I request consideration for deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 if I live in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI)?A86: Yes, in certain circumstances. The CNMI is part of the United States for immigration purposes and is not excluded from this process. However, because of the specific guidelines for consideration of DACA, individuals who have been residents of the CNMI are in most cases unlikely to meet the criteria at 8 CFR 236.22(b). You must, among other things, have come to the United States before your 16th birthday and have resided continuously in the United States since June 15, 2007.Under the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008, the CNMI became part of the United States for purposes of immigration law only on Nov. 28, 2009. Therefore, entry into, or residence in, the CNMI before that date is not entry into, or residence in, the United States for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b).We have used parole authority in a variety of situations in the CNMI to address humanitarian needs on a case-by-case basis since Nov. 28, 2009. If you live in the CNMI and believe that you meet the guidelines for consideration of deferred action under this process, except that your entry or residence to the CNMI took place entirely or in part before Nov. 28, 2009, we are willing to consider your situation on a case-by-case basis for a grant of parole. If this situation applies to you, you should make an appointment  in Saipan to discuss your case with an immigration officer.Q87: Will USCIS expedite the processing of my pending DACA request?A87: We consider all expedite requests on a case-by-case basis and generally requires documentation to support such requests. The decision to grant or deny an expedite request is within our sole discretion. Please visit the USCIS Policy Manual Chapter 5 - Requests to Expedite Applications or Petitions for more information and guidance on expedite requests.Evidence showing the humanitarian need for expediting your DACA request may include, but is not limited to, evidence of loss of employment, disenrollment from an educational program, or medical or health-related emergencies.We strongly recommend that you submit your DACA renewal requests between 120 and 150 days before your current period of DACA expires to minimize the risk of your DACA lapsing.Q88: Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my DACA request. Is this true?A88: No. While practitioners may charge a fee for preparation of your DACA request, including a request to expedite, an attorney or accredited representative who guarantees faster processing by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you and take your money. Visit our Avoid Scams page to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams.Although you may request that USCIS expedite processing of your DACA request, there is no fee to request expedited processing. Make sure you seek information about requests for consideration of DACA from official government sources such as USCIS or DHS. If you are seeking legal advice, visit our Find Legal Services page to learn how to choose a licensed attorney or accredited representative.Q89: Am I required to register with the Selective Service?A89:  Most male persons residing in the United States, who are ages 18 through 25, are required to register with Selective Service. Visit the Selective Service System website for more information.Q90: How can I tell if an employer is discriminating against me because I am a DACA recipient?A90: An employer may be engaging in discrimination if they:Demand that an employee show specific documents or ask for more or different documents than are required to complete Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, or create an E-Verify case; orReject documents from the Lists of Acceptable Documents that reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, including documentation showing work authorization because it has a future expiration date or because of an employee’s prior unauthorized status.The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice has an office dedicated to ensuring that employers do not discriminate against individuals who are permitted to work in the United States. These include DACA recipients who have been granted work authorization. If you think your employer may be discriminating against you, contact the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD for the deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-237-2515).For more information about unfair employment practices against DACA recipients, please read IER’s factsheet in English  (PDF) or Spanish  (PDF).For additional resources and information about workers’ rights, visit the Department of Justice Reminders for DACA Recipients and Employers webpage.Return to top.",

          "question": "A. What Is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals?",
          "answer": "As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to focus its enforcement resources on those who pose the greatest threat to homeland security, DHS will exercise prosecutorial discretion as appropriate to ensure that enforcement resources are not expended on individuals who do not fall into this category, such as individuals who came to the United States as children and meet other key guidelines. Individuals who demonstrate that they meet the guidelines below may request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal for a period of 2 years, and may be eligible for employment authorization. We may approve a request for DACA only if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you meet each of the following threshold criteria and merit a favorable exercise of discretion: Were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012 (that is, you were born on or after June 16, 1981);Came to the United States before reaching your 16th birthday;Have continuously resided in the United States since June 15, 2007, up to the time of filing your request for DACA;Were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time you filed your request for DACA with USCIS;Had no lawful immigration status on June 15, 2012, and at the time you filed your request for DACA, meaning that: You never had a lawful immigration status on or before June 15, 2012*, orAny lawful immigration status or parole that you had before June 15, 2012, expired on or before June 15, 2012, andAny lawful status that you had after June 15, 2012, expired or otherwise terminated before you submitted your request for DACA; Are currently enrolled in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard or armed forces of the United States; andHave not been convicted of a felony, a misdemeanor described in 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6), or 3 or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. * Please review Q19 below if you are currently in a lawful immigration status. You may call us at 800-375-5283 with questions or to request more information on DACA.If you have a pending request, we haveonline self-help toolsyou can use to check your case status and processing times, change your address, and send an inquiry about a case pending longer than posted processing times or about non-delivery of a card or document. Q1: What is deferred action?A1: Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. For purposes of future inadmissibility based on prior periods ofunlawful presencein the United States, an individual is not considered to be unlawfully present during the period when deferred action is in effect. An individual who has received deferred action is authorized by DHS to be in the United States for the duration of the deferred action period.  Deferred action recipients are also considered to belawfully presentas described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi) for purposes of eligibility for certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) during the period of deferred action. However, deferred action does not conferlawful immigration statusupon an individual, nor does it excuse any previous or subsequent periods of unlawful presence they may have. Under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33), an individual who has been granted deferred action under 8 CFR 236.21 through 236.23, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, may receive employment authorization for the period of deferred action, provided they can demonstrate “an economic necessity for employment.” Under 8 CFR 236.23(d), we may terminate a grant of DACA at any time, at the agency’s discretion. Please see Q28 for more information. Q2: What is DACA?A2: On June 15, 2012, the secretary of homeland security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several key guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal, and, if approved, will then be eligible for work authorization if they can demonstrate economic necessity. On Aug. 30, 2022, DHS issued theDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Final Ruleto preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum. The final rule is effective as of Oct. 31, 2022. Individuals who can demonstrate through verifiable documentation that they meet these guidelines will be considered for deferred action. We will make determinations on a case-by-case basis under the DACA final rule. All guidance in these FAQs stems from the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25. Q3: I currently have DACA. How does the DACA Final Rule impact me?A3: If you are a current DACA recipient, your grant of deferred action and related work authorization, as well as any DACA advance parole document issued, will remain in effect and will expire according to their existing terms. Any requests for renewals of those grants are now governed by the regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 and not the 2012 Napolitano Memorandum. Q4: Is there any difference between “deferred action” and DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25?A4: DACA is a form of deferred action. The relief an individual receives with a grant of DACA under 8 CFR 236.21-236.25 is identical for immigration purposes to the relief obtained by any person who receives deferred action as an act of prosecutorial discretion. Q5: If my removal is deferred under the DACA final rule, am I eligible for employment authorization?A5: Yes. Under the regulations at 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(33) if you receive DACA under the DACA final rule, you may obtain employment authorization from USCIS provided you can demonstrate an economic necessity for employment. Q6: If my case is deferred, am I in lawful status for the period of deferral?A6: No. Although action on your case has been deferred and you do not accrue unlawful presence (for admissibility purposes) during the period of deferred action, deferred action does not confer any lawful immigration status. The fact that you are not accruing unlawful presence does not change that you are in unlawful status while you remain in the United States. However, although deferred action does not confer a lawful immigration status, you may stay in the United States while your deferred action is in effect. For admissibility purposes, you will not accrue “unlawful presence” while you have deferred action. You are also considered to be “lawfully present” in the United States while you have deferred action for purposes of certain public benefits (such as certain Social Security benefits) as described in 8 C.F.R. sec. 1.3(a)(4)(vi). Federal law does not prevent individuals granted deferred action from establishing domicile in the United States. Apart from the immigration laws, “lawful presence,” “lawful status” and similar terms are used in various other federal and state laws. For information on how those laws affect individuals who receive a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion under DACA, please contact the appropriate federal, state, or local authorities. Note: It is a federal crime for an alien who is “illegally or unlawfully in the United States,” among others, to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. See 18 U.S. 922(g)(5)(A). This prohibition applies to DACA recipients. Q7: Can I renew my period of deferred action and employment authorization under DACA?A7: Yes. You may request consideration for a renewal of your DACA. We will consider your request for a renewal on a case-by-case basis under 8 CFR 236.22-23. If we renew our exercise of discretion under DACA for your case, you will receive deferred action for another 2 years, and if you show an economic necessity for employment, you may receive employment authorization for that period.

If we have approved your application for advance parole, the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas does not affect that approval. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry.Q24. I have DACA and am currently outside the United States using advance parole. Can I still return to the United States using my advance parole under DACA?A24. Yes, if you currently have DACA and are outside the United States using advance parole, you may return to the United States using your advance parole under the same conditions that were in effect before the order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Please note, all individuals returning to the United States are still subject to immigration inspection at a port of entry.Q25. I filed an advance parole application and am scheduled for biometrics after July 16, 2021. What should I do?A25. You should attend your biometrics appointment and proceed with the advance parole application process.Q26. I have DACA and I need to travel abroad for emergency reasons now. What should I do?A26. If you currently have DACA, you may apply for advance parole. If you are experiencing an extremely urgent situation, you may request an emergency advance parole appointment at your local field office through the USCIS Contact Center. You should bring the following items to your appointment:A completed and signed Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records;The correct Form I-131 filing fee;Evidence to support the emergency request (for example, medical documentation, death certificate, etc.); andTwo passport-style photos.For more information, please see the DACA Frequently Asked Questions.EmployersQ27. What should I do if my current or new employee is a DACA recipient?A27. The Sept. 13, 2023 decision from the U.S. District Court from the Southern District of Texas expanded its July 16, 2021 injunction and vacatur order to the DACA Final Rule, but maintained the partial stay for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021,” so the recent court order does not disturb the grant of deferred action or the validity of work authorization for current DACA recipients. USCIS will also continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewal and associated applications for employment authorization. USCIS will also continue to accept and adjudicate applications for replacement EADs. Your current and new employees with DACA may continue to receive valid EADs after the date of the court orders.No action is required for current employees who are DACA recipients who have presented valid EADs. The U.S. Department of Justice has issued guidance for DACA recipients and their employers that also clarifies this. Neither the litigation nor the implementation date of the final DACA rule on Oct. 31 affect current valid grants of DACA or related employment authorization.New employees who are DACA recipients and who present unexpired EADs are also authorized to work. See I-9 Central for more information on completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, for new employees as well as additional employment authorization documents DACA recipients may present.The court decision is not a basis to ask any employee to show more or different documentation to verify or reverify their employment authorization on Form I-9.If you participate in E-Verify, the system can confirm identity and employment eligibility for new employees who are DACA recipients with a valid and unexpired EAD.For information about the rights of employees, please see the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Immigrant and Employee Rights Section's information on employee rights.Previous Litigation Updates:Oct. 14, 2022On Oct. 5, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision  (PDF) on the 2012 Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) policy in Texas et al. v. United States of America et al., No. 21-40680 (5th Cir. 2022). The court partially affirmed the district court’s July 2021 decision declaring the 2012 DACA policy unlawful. However, the court of appeals preserved the partial stay issued by the district court in July 2021 and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings regarding the new DHS DACA regulation published on Aug. 30, 2022 and scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 31, 2022. On Oct. 14, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued an order extending its injunction and partial stay to the DACA Final Rule.At this time, this ruling does not affect current grants of DACA for existing DACA recipients and related Employment Authorization Documents. While the DACA final rule is considered by the court, consistent with the court orders and the ongoing partial stay, we continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests, accompanying requests for employment authorization, and applications for advance parole for current DACA recipients, and will continue to accept but not process initial DACA requests. Current valid grants of DACA, related employment authorization, and advance parole will continue to be recognized as valid under the final rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related employment authorization do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.Beginning on Oct. 31, DHS will continue to grant or deny DACA renewal requests and related requests for employment authorization, in accordance with 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, pursuant to the DACA regulation. Pending requests will be adjudicated under the Final Rule beginning on Oct. 31 and do not need to be re-filed. However, under the court orders DHS remains prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and accompanying requests for employment authorization.The FAQs below provide additional information.We will provide additional updates as more information is available.July 16, 2021On July 16, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas held in State of Texas, et al., v. United States of America, et al., 1:18-CV-00068, (S.D. Texas July 16, 2021) that the DACA policy reflected in the June 15, 2012 DACA memorandum “is illegal.” The court granted summary judgment on plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims; vacated the 2012 DACA memorandum; remanded the memorandum to DHS for further consideration; and issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the government’s continued administration of DACA and the reimplementation of DACA without compliance with the APA. However, the court temporarily stayed part of its order vacating the DACA memorandum and its injunction with regard to individuals who obtained DACA on or before July 16, 2021, including those with renewal requests.Dec. 4, 2020Consistent with this July 16, 2021, court order and with the stay, DHS continues to accept the filing of both initial and DACA renewal requests, as well as accompanying requests for employment authorization. In compliance with an order of a U.S. district court, and effective Dec. 7, 2020, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is:Accepting first-time requests for consideration of deferred action under DACA based on the terms of the DACA policy in effect before Sept. 5, 2017 and in accordance with the court’s Dec. 4, 2020 order;Accepting DACA renewal requests based on the terms of the DACA policy in effect before Sept. 5, 2017 and in accordance with the court’s Dec. 4, 2020 order;Accepting applications for advance parole documents based on the terms of the DACA policy before Sept. 5, 2017 and in accordance with the court’s Dec. 4, 2020 order;Extending one-year grants of deferred action under DACA to 2 years; andExtending one-year EADs under DACA to 2 years.USCIS has taken appropriate steps to provide evidence of the 1-year extensions of deferred action and EADs under DACA to individuals who were issued documentation on or after July 28, 2020 with a one-year validity period under the defunct policy.DHS will comply with the order while it is in effect.",

However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” See theMemorandum and OrderandSupplemental Order of Injunction. Accordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated. USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, as it has since October 31, 2022, in accordance with this decision. We will also continue to accept initial DACA requests, but, per the order, not process them. Current valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal. The FAQs below provide additional information. We will provide additional updates as needed. General Q1. What is the latest information regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)? A1. On Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Final Rule unlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021 injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” Accordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated. In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. We will also continue to accept but not process initial DACA requests. See theMemorandum and OrderandSupplemental Order of Injunction. Current valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal. Q2. What did the court orders say? What do they mean? A2. The Sept. 13, 2023, order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas found the DACA Final Rule unlawful, but maintained a partial stay of its order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” The partial stay allows DHS to continue to accept initial as well as DACA renewal requests, but permits DHS to approve only renewal requests and prohibits DHS from approving initial DACA requests. Therefore, consistent with this order, USCIS is continuing to accept the filing of both initial and DACA renewal requests, as well as accompanying applications for employment authorization, but will not grant initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021 and their accompanying requests for employment authorization. USCIS will grant or deny DACA renewal requests pursuant to the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. Current valid grants of DACA, related employment authorization and advance parole will continue to be recognized as valid. DHS will comply with the court order while it is in effect. Q3. Is the DACA policy over? A3. No. While the court order does not allow USCIS to approve initial DACA requests, we are presently able to continue processing DACA renewals and associated applications because the court maintained a partial stay of its injunction for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.”. While USCIS will continue accepting initial DACA requests, the ongoing injunction and partial stay continue to prohibit DHS from granting initial DACA requests after July 16, 2021 and their accompanying requests for employment authorization. USCIS will continue to adjudicate requests for DACA renewals and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) and advance parole. Q4. What does this recent court decision mean if I am: A4. For more information about submitting initial DACA requests or DACA renewal requests, see additional questions and answers below. Q5. What is considered an “initial” DACA request? A5. An initial request for DACA includes: Q6. What is considered a DACA “renewal” request? A6. A DACA renewal request includes: Q7. What does this mean if I have an initial DACA request currently pending with USCIS? A7. USCIS is not allowed to approve"

          "answer": "ALERT:On November 7, 2024, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas inState of Texas v. Department of Homeland Security, Case Number 24-cv-306 (E.D.T.X. Nov. 7, 2024) issued a final judgment vacating the Keeping Families Together (KFT) parole process, published at 89 Fed. Reg. 67,459 (Aug. 20, 2024). Effective immediately, USCIS is taking the following steps to comply with the Court’s Order: In the coming days, USCIS will publish additional information on how it will handle pending cases and paid application fees. Q. What is Keeping Families Together? A. Keeping Families Together is a process that allows certain alien spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to apply for parole in place to enable them to apply for lawful permanent resident status without having to be separated from their families by leaving the United States for processing. Parole is an exercise of DHS’s discretionary authority under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to allow certain alien “applicants for admission” to be present in the United States on a temporary, case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit. The INA defines an “applicant for admission,” in relevant part, as an alien “present in the United States who has not been admitted.” Aliens who are present in the United States without admission or parole may be considered for parole in place under this process because they remain “applicants for admission.” Parole in place is available only for aliens who are present in the United States. Those who receive parole are eligible to apply for work authorization for the period of parole Q. Which form should I file to apply for Keeping Families Together? Can I file online? A. Requestors (the alien spouse or stepchild) must fileForm I-131F, Application for Parole in Place for Certain Noncitizen Spouses and Stepchildren of U.S. Citizens, under this process. The form can only be filed online. Paper-based applications sent to USCIS by mail will be rejected (not accepted or receipted). We have created a Filing Guide for Form I-131F to help individuals as they prepare to file a request for parole in place through the online process. Q. What fee is required to file a request under Keeping Families Together (Form I-131F)?Can I obtain a fee waiver or fee exemption for this process? A. The fee to apply is $580. No fee waivers or fee exemptions are available for this process at this time. Q. Someone told me if I pay them a fee, they can expedite my Form I-131F or guarantee that it will be approved. Is this true? A. No. While an attorney or accredited representative may charge a fee to prepare your request, anyone who guarantees faster processing or a positive outcome by USCIS if you pay them a fee may be trying to scam you. Visit ourAvoid Scamspage to learn how you can protect yourself from immigration scams. Please also remember that USCIS will begin accepting requests for this process on Aug. 19, 2024.Any filings received before this date will be rejected by USCIS (not accepted or receipted). Q. If my Keeping Families Together request is granted, how long will my parole period last? A. In general, if you are granted parole as an alien spouse or alien stepchild of a U.S. citizen under this process, your parole period will be valid as of the date USCIS approves your Form I-131F and will expire 3 years from that date. However, parole terminates automatically if you depart the United States. Parole may also be terminated at any time in DHS’s discretion upon a determination that parole is no longer warranted, for example, following the commission of criminal conduct. As long as your parole remains valid (that is, is not expired or terminated), you will be considered in a period of authorized stay. As a parolee, you may apply for any immigration status for which you may be otherwise eligible, including adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident. Q. What are the eligibility criteria for Keeping Families Together? A. To be considered for this process as an alien spouse of a U.S. citizen, you must: To be considered for this process as an alien stepchild of a U.S. citizen, you must: *NOTE:Consistent with the Sept. 30, 2021,Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law  (PDF), an alien who poses a threat to border security will be generally disqualified from receiving parole in place pursuant to this process. However, there is an exception for stepchildren who entered the United States unlawfully after Nov. 1, 2020, and who otherwise meet the criteria for parole in place under this process. All such requests for parole in place are considered on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, in the exercise of discretion, taking into account the totality of the circumstances of each individual request. Q. If I meet the criteria listed above, will I be guaranteed to have my Form I-131F approved und"

For information on ways to obtain asylum in the United States, visit theObtaining Asylum in the United Statespage. Yes. Every individual who applies for asylum will be subject to a series of background/security checks. You will not have to complete any additional steps to complete your background/security check once you have submitted your Form I-589 and have had your fingerprints taken. Depending on the results of these mandatory checks, you may not be eligible for a final grant of asylum. Your application may be referred to immigration court for removal proceedings. The background/security check consists of the following: Applicants 12 years and 9 months of age and older receive a notice to go to an Application Support Center or authorized Designated Law Enforcement Agency to have their fingerprints taken. After the USCIS Service Center receives your completed Form I-589, you will be sent a notice to go to an Application Support Center or authorized Designated Law Enforcement Agency to have your fingerprints taken. You are exempt from the fingerprint or biometric fee. The fingerprints will be sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for a background/security check. The FBI will send those results to USCIS.  Additional information about the fingerprinting process can be found on the Fingerprints webpage below, or by calling the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283. Do notsubmit a completed fingerprint card (FD-258) or fingerprint fee with your application. Your application will be accepted without the fingerprint card attached. If you submit a completed fingerprint card with your application on or after March 29, 1998, the card will be rejected and you will be re-fingerprinted by USCIS. If you are asking for derivative asylum status for your spouse and children, they will also need to be fingerprinted if they are between 12 years and 9 months of age and 79 years of age.  Additional information about the fingerprinting process can be found on the Fingerprints webpage below, or by calling the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283. You will receive a Final Denial of your asylum claim if you received a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) and either did not provide a response to the letter within 16 days, or the asylum officer determined that the evidence or argument you provided failed to overcome the grounds for denial as stated in the NOID. You will have asylee status. You will receive an I-94 Arrival and Departure record documenting that you are able to remain indefinitely in the United States as an asylee. You will be authorized to work in the United States for as long as you remain in asylee status. You may obtain a photo-identity document from USCIS evidencing your employment authorization by applying for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). You will also be able to request derivative asylum status for any spouse or child (unmarried and under 21 years of age as of the date you filed the asylum application, as long as your asylum application was pending on or after Aug. 6, 2002) who was not included as a dependent in your asylum decision and with whom you have a qualifying relationship. This means that you will be able to petition to bring your spouse and/or children to the United States or allow them to remain in the United States indefinitely incident to your asylee status. Asylees are eligible to apply for certain benefits, including an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), an unrestricted Social Security card, cash and medical assistance, employment assistance, and a Refugee Travel Document. For more information on the benefits and responsibilities associated with asylee status, see see theAsylumwebpage The Immigration Courts are located within the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the U.S. Department of Justice.
