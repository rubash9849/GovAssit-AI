      "content": "Working in the United States\nMany aliens want to come to the United States to work. This page provides a summary of employment-based nonimmigrant and immigrant visa classifications and other categories of aliens who are eligible for employment authorization. Each classification provides a link to more detailed information on its requirements.\nA common way to work temporarily in the United States as a nonimmigrant is for a prospective employer to file a petition with USCIS on your behalf. The\nTemporary (Nonimmigrant) Workers webpage\ndescribes the main nonimmigrant temporary worker classifications.\nIf you have the right combination of skills, education, and/or work experience, you may be able to live and work permanently in the United States by seeking an employment-based immigrant visa. The\nPermanent Workers webpage\ndescribes the five employment-based immigrant visa preferences (also called categories).\nIf you live outside the United States and want to work here, you generally must apply for a visa from the U.S. Department of State (DOS), unless a visa is not required for people from your country of nationality. You may visit\nDOS’ Travel Without a Visa page\nfor more information.\nIn many cases, USCIS must approve your petition before you are eligible to apply to DOS for a visa or seek admission at a port of entry. Before entering the United States, you must present yourself to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer and receive permission to enter the United States and engage in your proposed activity.\nIf you are in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status that does not provide employment authorization, you generally may apply for:\nA change of status to a nonimmigrant classification that provides employment authorization; or\nAn adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident. This may be a\nconcurrent filing\nwith an immigrant visa petition or, depending on the circumstances, may require an applicant to obtain an approved immigrant visa before applying for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident.\nDepending on the classification you seek, your change or adjustment of status application might require a U.S. employer or other qualified requestor to file an application or petition on your behalf to establish your eligibility before we approve your application. However, if you apply based on certain classifications (for example, an alien with extraordinary ability or as a nonimmigrant E-1 or E-2 principal treaty trader or investor), you may be eligible to self-petition, which means filing an application on your own behalf.\nAdditionally, if you are in the United States, including if you are an applicant for permanent residence or a certain family member of an alien who has lawful nonimmigrant status, you may file\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, to request employment authorization and an\nEmployment Authorization Document\n(EAD). You may also apply for an EAD that shows such authorization if your immigration status authorizes you to work in the United States without restrictions.\nThe conditions you must meet and how long you can work in the United States depend on the type of immigration status the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants. You must comply with all conditions of your employment authorization and the terms of your admission to this country. If you violate any of the conditions, you could be removed from or denied re-entry into the United States.\nTopics\nTemporary (Nonimmigrant) Worker\nFind more information about the filing requirements for nonimmigrant visa classifications.\nPermanent (Immigrant) Worker\nIf you want to immigrate to the United States based on your job skills, read more information on the five employment-based immigrant visa preferences.\nStudents and Exchange Visitors\nIf you want to pursue full-time academic or vocational studies in the United States, you may be eligible for one of two nonimmigrant student categories.\nTemporary Visitors for Business\nIf you want to visit the United States for business, you need to obtain a temporary visitor for business visa. Read more information on eligibility and the application process.\nInternational Entrepreneur Parole\nUnder the International Entrepreneur Rule (IER), DHS may grant a period of authorized stay to foreign entrepreneurs who demonstrate that their stay in the United States would provide a significant public benefit through their business venture.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Concurrent Filing of Form I-485\nConcurrent filing of\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n, is when an adjustment of status application (Form I-485) is filed before the approval of the underlying immigrant visa petition. We will consider the immigrant visa petition and the Form I-485 concurrently filed when you file them at the same time and mail them together with all the required filing fees and supporting documentation to the same filing location. We also will consider them concurrently filed if you file the Form I-485 after the immigrant visa petition but while the immigrant visa petition remains pending.\nWho can file concurrently?\nWe allow concurrent filing for all of the following applicants when we have jurisdiction over the application to adjust status:\nImmediate relatives of U.S. citizens\nPreference relatives of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents when a visa number is immediately available;\nWidow(ers) of a U.S. citizen;\nMost employment-based applicants and their eligible family members when a visa number is immediately available;\nSpecial Immigrant Juveniles if an EB-4 visa number is immediately available;\nSelf-petitioning battered spouse or child if:\nThe abusive spouse or parent is a U.S. citizen; or\nIf an immigrant visa number is immediately available;\nCertain members of the armed forces applying for a special immigrant visa under Section 101(a)(27)(K) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA); and\nSpecial Immigrant International Organization Employees or family members.\nConsular Processing and Concurrent Filing\nConcurrent filing cannot occur in consular processed cases, because the immigrant petition is filed with USCIS and the application for an immigrant visa is filed with the Department of State. Therefore, concurrent filing is only available for an applicant who is physically present in the United States and requesting to adjust to lawful permanent resident status (becomes a Green Card holder).\nVisa Availability and Concurrent Filing\nYou may file your petition and application concurrently when there is a visa number immediately available at the time of filing. Concurrent filing is always allowed for all immediate relatives of a United States citizen because there are no numeric limitations in this category. However, in some categories, even if there is a visa number available at the time of filing, you may not be allowed to file concurrently unless you have an approved basis of eligibility (that is, an approved petition) before being allowed to file for adjustment of status. For more information on whether you can file concurrently, refer to the instructions on your immigrant petition:\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\nWhen adjudicating concurrent filings, we determine the eligibility for the immigrant visa petition first. If a visa number remains available for the immigrant classification and your Form I-485 is approvable (which, in certain cases, requires an interview), we will generally consider the adjustment application at the same time. We will mail separate decision notices for both forms.\nFor more information, see our\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\npage.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n06/20/2024\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "International Entrepreneur Rule\nAlert Type info\nALERT\n: On Oct. 1, 2024, the new investment and revenue amounts in the International Entrepreneur Rule (IER) will become effective and apply to applications filed on or after Oct. 1, 2024. USCIS will update Form I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole, and its instructions to reflect these updated amounts in the near future.\nBy regulation, the investment and revenue amounts must be automatically adjusted every three years by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and posted on the USCIS website. In a\nfinal rule\npublished on July 25, 2024, DHS calculated the new investment and revenue amounts and revised the applicable provisions to adjust for inflation. The new amounts will take effect at the start of fiscal year 2025, which begins on Oct. 1, 2024. As explained in the 2024 final rule:\nIf relying on an investment from a qualifying investor, the amount is increasing from $264,147 to $311,071.\nIf relying on a government award or grant, the amount is increasing from $105,659 to $124,429.\nThe revenue amount for consideration of re-parole is increasing from $528,293 to $622,142.\nAn individual or organization may be a qualified investor if they made investments in start-up entities comprising a total of no less than $746,571 (rather than $633,952) in a specified 5-year period and, subsequent to those investments, at least two of those entities have each created at least five jobs or generated at least $622,142 (rather than $528,293) in revenue with annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.\nFor more information, see the\nFederal Register notice\n.\nUnder the\nInternational Entrepreneur Rule\n(IER), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may use its authority to grant a period of authorized stay, on a case-by-case basis, to alien entrepreneurs who show that their stay in the United States would provide a significant public benefit through their business venture and that they merit a favorable exercise of discretion. This period of authorized stay is called “parole.”\nUnder this rule, entrepreneurs granted parole will be eligible to work only for their startup business. The spouse and children of the alien entrepreneur may also be eligible for parole.\nThreshold criteria and key elements of the International Entrepreneur Rule include:\nEntrepreneurs may be either living abroad or already in the United States.\nStartup entities must have been formed in the United States within the past five years.\nStartup entities must show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation by showing at least $311,071 in qualified investments from qualifying investors, at least $124,429 in qualified government awards or grants,\nor\nalternative evidence.\nThe spouse of the entrepreneur may apply for employment authorization after being paroled into the United States. (Children are not eligible for employment authorization.)\nThe entrepreneur may be granted an initial parole period of up to 2.5 years. If approved for re-parole, based on additional benchmarks in funding, job creation, or revenue described below, the entrepreneur may receive up to another 2.5 years, for a maximum of 5 years. (At that point or earlier, there are other\nOptions for Alien Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States\n.)\nUp to 3 entrepreneurs per startup can be eligible for parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule.\nSee the drop-down menus below for more detailed information and frequently asked questions (FAQs) for each section. For full details about the International Entrepreneur Rule, you should review:\nComprehensive guidance on the International Entrepreneur Rule\nin our Policy Manual;\nOur\nForm I-941\npage, where you can find both the\nApplication for Entrepreneur Parole\nand\nform instructions\n; and\nThe International Entrepreneur Rule itself, as published in the\nFederal Register\nand codified in\n8 CFR section 212.19\n.\nOverview of the International Entrepreneur Rule (FAQs)\nWhat level of ownership and role in the startup entity is required?\nYou must have a substantial ownership (which we consider to be at least 10% at time of the initial application’s adjudication) in the startup business and have a central and active role in its operations.\nWhat are the requirements for the startup entity?\nThe startup must be a U.S. business entity that is lawfully conducting business in the United States and was formed within the 5 years immediately preceding the application for initial parole. It must also have substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\nWhat type and level of funding are required to demonstrate that the startup entity has the substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation?\nYou must be able to document that, within the past 18 months, the entity received the following funding:\nA qualified investment of at least the required amount from a qualifying investor ($311,071 as of Oct. 1, 2024);\nA qualified award or grant of at least the required amount from a U.S. federal, state, or local government entity ($124,429 as of Oct. 1, 2024); or\nAlternatively, if the startup entity partially meets one or both above funding levels, you may submit additional reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\nWhile nothing precludes you from personally investing in the startup entity or otherwise securing additional funding, only qualified investments from a qualifying investor count towards the minimum investment amount.\nA qualified investor:\nIs an individual who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States, or an organization located in the United States and that operates through a legal entity organized under the laws of the United States or any state, that is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States;\nRegularly makes substantial investments in startup entities that subsequently exhibit substantial growth in terms of revenue generation or job creation; and\nDuring the preceding 5 years:\nMade investments in startup entities in exchange for equity, convertible debt or other security convertible into equity commonly used in financing transactions within their respective industries for a total in such 5-year period of no less than a certain investment amount ($746,571 as of Oct. 1, 2024); and\nAfter such investment by such individual or organization, at least two such entities each created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated revenue of at least a certain amount ($622,142 as of Oct. 1, 2024), with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.\nA qualified investor is\nnot\n:\nYou or any of your immediate relatives;\nAn organization you or your immediate relatives have a direct or indirect ownership interest in;\nPermanently or temporarily enjoined from participating in the offer or sale of a security or in the provision of services as an investment adviser, broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, government securities dealer, bank, transfer agent, or credit rating agency;\nBarred from association with any entity involved in the offer or sale of securities or provision of such services; or\nOtherwise found to have participated in the offer or sale of securities or provision of such services in violation of law.\nA qualified investment means a purchase from a startup entity of its equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into its equity commonly used in financing transactions in such entity's industry.\nWe have also published\ncomprehensive guidance on the International Entrepreneur Rule\nin our Policy Manual.\nCan my spouse and children accompany me to the United States?\nYour spouse and children (unmarried, minor child under 21 years of age) can also apply for parole by filing\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, either when you file your Form I-941, or after you file it.\nCan my spouse work in the United States?\nSpouses of aliens, after being paroled into the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule, may apply for employment authorization by filing\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n.\nWhat is the maximum time I may remain in the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nYou may be granted an initial period of parole for up to 2.5years. If approved for a new period of parole (also known as re-parole), you may receive another period of parole for up to 2.5 years, for a maximum of 5 years.\nCan I apply for parole from outside the United States?\nYes, if you and the startup entity meet all the criteria for consideration. If you are outside the United States and seeking an initial period of parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule, you must submit biometrics (fingerprints and photo). We will send you a notice explaining where to submit biometrics after we coordinate with the Department of State or the international USCIS field office closest to you.\nCan I change to an immigrant or nonimmigrant status?\nAt any time during the authorized stay, you may apply for classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, if you are eligible. However, as parole is not admission, you would generally be ineligible for adjustment or change of status while in the United States. As a result, if your nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is approved, you may have to depart the United States to apply for a visa based on the petition approval (unless visa exempt) before traveling to a port of entry to request admission into the United States as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, as applicable.\nCan I apply if I am in nonimmigrant status, such as B-1 or F-1? Can I apply if I have overstayed the term of my nonimmigrant status, but I believe I fulfill the other criteria?\nIf you are currently in the United States in nonimmigrant status, you can apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. If you are not presently maintaining nonimmigrant status you may also apply, but you would have to depart the United States to be paroled back in if authorized. However, a failure to maintain your nonimmigrant status may result in immigration consequences including but not limited to removal, inadmissibility, and being barred from adjustment of status in some categories.\nHow to Apply as an Entrepreneur\nFiling Form I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole\nYou must file\nForm I-941, Application for Entrepreneur Parole\n, with the required fee and supporting documents according to the Form I-941 instructions.\nFiling and obtaining approval of a Form I-941 under this rule will not, by itself, constitute a grant of parole. If your Form I-941 is conditionally approved and you are outside the United States, you must visit a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad to complete parole processing and obtain travel documentation (for example, a boarding foil) before appearing at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination. If your Form I-941 is approved and you are within the United States, you will be mailed travel documentation to the U.S. address listed on your Form I-941, unless you requested to receive the travel documentation through a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. You would have to depart the United States before appearing at a U.S. port of entry using your travel documentation for a final parole determination. A Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry may present an approved or conditionally approved Form I-941 at the U.S. port of entry without first obtaining travel documentation.\nYou (as the Form I-941 applicant) do not need to file a Form I-765 to obtain employment authorization. If your Form I-941 is approved and you are paroled into the United States under the International Entrepreneur Rule after appearing at a U.S. port of entry, you are employment authorized for your startup entity incident to the grant of parole.\nYou (as the Form I-941 applicant) do not need to file a Form I-131 to obtain travel documentation. If your Form I-941 is approved, USCIS will provide you with further instructions for obtaining and using your travel documentation dependent on whether you selected to receive your travel documentation at your U.S. mailing address or at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad.\nIMPORTANT: If you are requesting to receive your travel document at your U.S. mailing address, please note that the I-512L Advance Parole document is a secure document that will only be sent to you at the U.S. mailing address you provided in your Form I-941 application. If you are represented by an attorney, an extra copy will not be sent to your attorney. Please ensure that your U.S. mailing address is correct, including any apartment, floor, or suite number if applicable, as well as providing any “In Care of Name” information, if any.\nIf you are requesting to receive your travel documentation through a U.S. embassy or consulate, please ensure your phone number and e-mail address are included and accurate as the U.S. embassy or consulate may try to contact you to schedule an appointment.\nFile your completed form(s) at the USCIS Dallas Lockbox facility.\nFor U.S. Postal Service (USPS):\nFor FedEx, UPS, and DHL deliveries:\nUSCIS\nAttn: IER\nPO Box 650890\nDallas, TX 75265\nUSCIS\nAttn: IER (Box 650890)\n2501 S.

We will mail this notice to your U.S. mailing address.\nIf you request to receive your parole documentation at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad, we will give you further instructions on how to appear for biometrics collection and identity verification at the U.S. embassy or consulate you listed on your application.\nIf you do not appear for your first biometrics appointment, we will send a second Biometrics Appointment Notice to your U.S. mailing address.\nIf you do not appear for your biometrics appointment after we have issued you 2 separate Biometrics Appointment Notices, we may issue you an Abandonment Denial.\nQ. How do you collect my biometrics if I am an I-941 applicant inside the United States?\nA. If you selected on your Form I-941 to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address, we will schedule a biometrics appointment based on your U.S. mailing address. You will receive a Biometrics Appointment Notice at your U.S. mailing address outlining the process to appear for a biometrics appointment at a USCIS application support center. If your\nU.S. mailing address changes\n, please ensure that you notify USCIS.\nQ. If I am an applicant outside the United States, how do you collect my biometrics?\nA. If you have selected on your Form I-941 to receive your travel documentation at a U.S. embassy or consulate, we may make an initial decision on your application before collecting biometrics. If we determine that you meet the threshold criteria for parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule and that you merit favorable discretion to receive parole, we will issue you a Conditional Approval Notice with instructions for further parole processing, including biometrics collection and identity verification, at the U.S. embassy or consulate you listed on your Form I-941. We will also contact the U.S. embassy or consulate to request that they schedule you for an appointment with the Department of State consular section.\nQ. I filed a Form I-941 while in the United States as a nonimmigrant. My nonimmigrant status expired, and I had to leave the United States before my biometrics appointment was scheduled. Will I have to return to the United States for my biometrics appointment, and what will happen if I cannot return to the United States?\nA. The location of biometrics collection depends on your response in your Form I-941 about where you choose to receive your parole document. If you have chosen to receive your parole document at your U.S. mailing address but are no longer in the United States and cannot return, you should contact the\nUSCIS Immigrant Investor Program Office\nimmediately to notify us of your change of address and request for overseas processing at a U.S. embassy or consulate. Please be sure to include your application receipt number in your communication.\nForm I-9 Information\nGiven that DHS does not anticipate that sole proprietors will be eligible to participate in this program, an alien entrepreneur granted parole will typically be an employee of the startup entity. Employees will need to complete Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification.\nThe following documents establish identity and employment authorization for employment with a specific employer for Form I-9 purposes under List A for an employee who is an entrepreneur granted parole:\nForeign passport; and\nForm I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, indicating entrepreneur parole (PE-1) as the class of admission. The Form I-94 must include the following:\nThe same name that appears on the passport; and\nAn endorsement of the individual’s parole, if that period of endorsement has not yet expired and the proposed employment is not in conflict with any restrictions or limitations identified on the form.\nFor information on Form I-9 requirements, see\nI-9 Central\n.\nThe spouse of an alien entrepreneur granted parole may also be eligible for parole and apply for employment authorization once the spouse is paroled into the United States (see more details above). The spouse is only authorized to work if DHS has issued them a Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document. Children of entrepreneurs granted parole under this rule are not eligible for employment based on this parole.\nThreshold Criteria for the Entrepreneur (FAQs)\nQ. How much of my startup must I own as an entrepreneur for it to be “substantial ownership?” Is there a minimum, such as 10%?\nA. We are guided by DHS regulations at\n8 CFR section 212.19.\nWe consider ownership interest “substantial” if you (the Form I-941 applicant) have at least a 10% ownership interest in the startup entity at the time of adjudication of the initial grant of parole, and if you have at least a 5% ownership interest in the startup entity at the time of adjudication of a subsequent period of re-parole.\nQ. What types of evidence can I provide to meet the regulatory requirement of having a central and active role in the operations of the startup entity?\nA. See below under\nFiling Tips and Evidence Checklist\nfor more detailed information.\nQ. What types of evidence can I provide to meet the regulatory requirement of being well-positioned, due to my knowledge, skills, or experience, to substantially assist the startup entity with the growth and success of its business?\nA. See below under\nFiling Tips and Evidence Checklist\nfor more detailed information.\nThreshold Criteria for the Startup Entity (FAQs)\nQ. What factors indicate “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation”?\nA. You can show substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation by the receipt of significant capital investment from U.S. investors with established records of successful investments in startup entities.\nYou can also show this through significant awards or grants from certain federal, state, or local government entities that regularly provide awards or grants to startup entities.\nDHS regulations also include alternative criteria for applicants who partially meet the thresholds for capital investment or government awards or grants and can provide additional reliable and compelling evidence of their entities' significant potential for rapid growth and job creation.\nQ. Can investments or grants be to a parent, subsidiary, affiliated or related company?\nA. No. The investment or grants must be made to the qualifying startup entity itself.\nQ. What is the minimum amount that USCIS considers a significant investment of capital?\nA. The startup entity must have received a qualified investment (at least $311,071 as of Oct. 1, 2024) from one or more qualified investors  within 18 months immediately preceding the filing of your Form I-941.\nA qualified investment means a purchase from a startup entity of its equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into its equity, commonly used in financing transactions within the startup entity's industry.\nA bank loan or personal loan that is\nnot\nconvertible into equity would typically\nnot\nmeet the regulatory definition of “qualified investment.”\nQ. What types of evidence can an entrepreneur submit to demonstrate that an investor in their startup entity meets the definition of a “qualified investor”?\nA. The regulation defines the term “qualified investor” to include an organization located in the United States and that operates through a legal entity organized under the laws of the United States or any state that is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.\nAlthough we do not require the applicant to establish that at least 50% of the capital contributed to the fund is sourced from U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, the applicant must nevertheless show that the firm is majority owned and controlled, directly and indirectly, by U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. For example, we recognize that many investment firms based in the United States, such as venture capital firms, have a wide range of funding from limited partners that vest control in U.S. citizen partners who manage and even “control” the fund.\nThe applicant must also establish, among other things, that the investor has a successful history of accomplishment making investments in startup entities, and that the investment is a good faith investment of lawfully derived capital.\nQ. What is the minimum threshold for an established record of successful investments?\nA. The definition of a “qualified investor” requires the investor to have a history of substantial investment in successful startup entities. For this requirement, we consider such an individual or organization a qualified investor if, during the preceding 5 years, the following apply:\nThe individual or organization made sufficient total investments in startup entities ($746,571 as of Oct. 1, 2024) in exchange for equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into equity commonly used in financing transactions within the startup entities’ respective industries; and\nAfter such investment by such individual or organization, at least 2 such startup entities each created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated at sufficient revenue ($528,293, as of Oct. 1, 2024) with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.\nA “qualified job” means full-time employment located in the United States that has been filled for at least 1 year by one or more U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, or other aliens lawfully authorized to be employed in the United States, who is not an entrepreneur of the relevant startup entity (or the parent, spouse, brother, sister, son, or daughter of such entrepreneur) nor an independent contractor.\nQ. What is the minimum threshold for government grants or awards?\nA. You can show “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation” if the startup entity has received at least  $124,429 (for applications filed on or after Oct. 1, 2024) through one or more qualified government awards or grants within 18 months immediately preceding the filing of Form I-941.\nQ. What types of government awards or grants would meet this requirement?\nA. A “qualified government award or grant” means an award or grant for economic development, research and development, or job creation (or other similar monetary award typically given to startup entities) made by a federal, state, or local government entity (not including foreign government entities) that regularly provides such awards or grants to startup entities. This definition excludes any contractual commitment for goods or services.\nSome examples of qualified government awards and grants may include:\nSmall Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer awards (see\nSBIR.gov\n)\nResearch and development (R&D) awards under the\nCHIPS for America\nprogram\nR&D awards from the\nU.S. Department of Energy\n, the\nNational Science Foundation\n, and other federal government agencies\nCertain R&D or commercialization awards from state or local government economic development agencies, such as the Ohio\nTechnology Validation and Startup Fund\n.\nQ. Does the government award or grant for the startup entity need to be initiated by the parole applicant or just by the entity that parole applicant is applying to work for?\nA. The government award or grant may be initiated by either the parole applicant or the startup entity. However, the grant must be awarded to the startup entity.\nQ. Can government awards or grants be from nations outside of the United States?\nA. No. Awards or grants from foreign government entities are not considered qualified government awards or grants under the International Entrepreneur Rule.\nQ. Why are the monetary thresholds for investment, revenue, and government awards and grants so specific?\nA. Every 3 years, by regulation, the threshold monetary amounts must increase according to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. We will publish the new amounts on our website, and a technical update to the regulation itself will appear in the Federal Register. We expect that the next automatic update will go into effect at the beginning of Fiscal Year 2025 (Oct. 1, 2024).\nAlternative Criteria\nQ. What if my startup entity does not reach the monetary thresholds for “qualified investment” or “qualified government award or grant” described above?\nA. If the startup-entity has raised less than the threshold “qualified investment” and/or “qualified government awards or grants,” the applicant may still be able to demonstrate “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation” through alternative reliable and compelling evidence.\nThe International Entrepreneur Rule recognizes that reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s “substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation” may vary depending on the nature of the business and the industry it operates in. Therefore, applicants providing other reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s potential are not limited to certain types of evidence.\nThis additional supporting evidence may include, but is not limited to:\nEvidence of rapid growth, such as:\nNumber of users or customers;\nRevenue generated by the startup entity; and\nAdditional investments/fundraising, including crowdfunding platforms;\nSocial impact of the startup entity;\nNational scope of the startup entity;\nPositive effects on the startup entity’s locality or region;\nSuccess using alternative funding platforms, including crowdfunding platforms;\nThe applicant’s academic degrees;\nThe applicant’s prior success in operating startup entities as shown by patented innovations, annual revenue, job creation, or other factors;\nSelection of the startup entity to participate in one or more established reputable startup accelerators or incubators; and\nAny other reliable and compelling evidence that the startup entity has substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\nQ. What if an investor in my startup entity meets some, but not all, of the criteria for a “qualified investor”?\nA. Only an investor that fully satisfies the definition of “qualified investor” can make a “qualified investment” under the International Entrepreneur Rule. There is no alternative evidence to establish that an individual or organization is a “qualified investor.”\nQ. What if my startup entity has multiple investors that add to up to more than the threshold amount in “qualified investment,” but not if USCIS determines that one of my investors is not a “qualified investor”?\nA. In your application, you can indicate that you want your startup entity to be considered based on raising more than the threshold amount\nor\nbased on raising less than the threshold amount plus alternative evidence. To do so, you can check “Yes” for both Question 10 and Question 14 on Form I-941, along with providing alternative evidence.\nFiling Tips and Evidence (FAQs)\nThe following checklist of required initial evidence is for informational purposes only. Please do not submit this checklist with your Form I-941. The checklist is an optional tool to use as you prepare your form, but does not replace statutory, regulatory, and form instruction requirements. We recommend that you review these requirements before completing and submitting your form. Do not send original documents unless specifically requested in the form instructions or applicable regulations.\nIf you submit any documents (copies or original documents, if requested) in a foreign language, you must include a full English translation along with a certification from the translator verifying that the translation is complete and accurate, and that they are competent to translate from the foreign language into English.\nUSCIS will evaluate all the evidence submitted, and will assess its credibility, relevance, and probative value, before determining whether the threshold criteria have been met and whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion. In addition to the examples of evidence listed below, an applicant is permitted (but not required) to submit alternative evidence that the applicant believes is credible, relevant, and probative. USCIS may also use open-source evidence to corroborate evidence submitted by the applicant.\nHow can I demonstrate that I have a central and active role in my startup entity?\nA copy of your employment agreement with the startup entity;\nDocumentation from the startup entity’s other founders, the director of human resources, or another employee in a position that can attest to your role at the startup entity; and/or\nSimilar evidence that provides a detailed description of your central and active role in the startup entity, including the day-to-day role you are currently performing for the startup entity.\nHow can I demonstrate that I am well-positioned, due to my knowledge, skills, and experience, to substantially assist the startup entity with the growth and success of its business?\nYour resume or curriculum vitae (CV);\nLetters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of the startup entity’s research, products or services, and your knowledge, skills or experience that would advance the entity’s business;\nNews articles or other similar evidence that you or your startup entity has received significant attention or recognition;\nEvidence that you or your startup entity has been recently invited to participate in, is currently participating in, or has graduated from one or more established and reputable startup accelerators;\nEvidence that you have played an active and central role in the success of prior startup entities;\nDegrees or other documentation indicating that you have knowledge, skills or experience that would significantly advance the startup entity’s business;\nDocumentation pertaining to intellectual property of the startup entity, such as a patent, that you obtained or that was a result of your efforts and expertise; and/or\nSimilar evidence that you are well positioned, due to your knowledge, skills, and experience, to substantially assist the startup entity with the growth and success of its business.\nHow can I demonstrate my ownership stake in the startup entity?\nOrganizational documents;\nEquity ledger or certificates;\nContracts;\nBank records;\nWire transfers; and/or\nSimilar evidence that demonstrates your ownership interest in the startup entity.\nHow can I demonstrate that my business meets the definition of “startup entity” under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nArticles of Incorporation;\nArticles of Formation; and/or\nSimilar evidence that your startup entity was created within the 5 years immediately preceding the filing date of your application (Form I-941) and evidence that your startup entity has lawfully done business during g any period of operation since its date of formation.\nHow can I demonstrate that my startup entity has received a qualified investment?\nEquity purchase agreements;\nConvertible debt agreements;\nEquity certificates;\nEquity ledgers;\nCapitalization tables;\nAudited financial statements;\nBank records;\nWire transfers; and/or\nOther evidence that the investment is a purchase from the startup entity of its equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into its equity commonly used in financing transactions within such entity’s industry.\nHow can I demonstrate that my investment comes from a U.S. investor?\nCopy of the investor’s passport or lawful permanent resident card;\nOwnership structure chart outlining direct and indirect ownership of the investment organization;\nOrganizational documents, including articles of incorporation, bylaws, articles of organization, operating agreement, certificate of partnership, partnership agreement; and/or\nOther evidence that the investor is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident or that individuals ultimately owning and controlling most of the organization are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.\nHow can I demonstrate that the investor has an established record of successful investments in other startup entities?\nEquity purchase agreements;\nTax and/or payroll records;\nBank records;\nWire transfers;\nConvertible debt agreements;\nEquity certificates;\nEquity ledgers;\nCapitalization tables;\nI-9 records;\nAudited financial statements;\nInformation from news articles or websites that provide relevant employment and/or revenue information about these other startup entities;\nInformation from news articles or websites relating to the investor’s previous investments and subsequent success of the startup entities, including information from the investor’s website; and/or\nOther evidence that the investor, during the preceding 5 years:\nMade investments in startup entities in exchange for equity, convertible debt, or other security convertible into equity commonly used in financing transactions within their respective industries for a total in such 5-year period of no less than the threshold amount ($746,571 as of Oct. 1, 2024); and\nAfter such investment, at least two such entities each created at least 5 qualified jobs or generated revenue of the threshold amount (at least $622,142 as of Oct. 1, 2024), with average annualized revenue growth of at least 20%.\nHow can I demonstrate that my startup entity has received significant awards or grants from federal, state, or local government entities that regularly provide such awards or grants to startup entities?\nNotice of grant or award;\nInformation from news articles or websites demonstrating that the government entity regularly makes such awards or grants to startup entities; and/or\nSimilar evidence showing that a qualified government award or grant was made by a federal, state, or local government entity to the startup entity, and that the government entity regularly makes such awards or grants to startup entities.\nHow can I demonstrate alternative criteria if I have only partially satisfied the investment or government grant or award criteria?\nA. See the section on\nAlternative Criteria\nabove.\nIf I have evidence that I meet all the eligibility requirements for an entrepreneur and a startup entity described above, should I submit any additional supporting evidence?\nA. When considering an application under the International Entrepreneur Rule, the USCIS officer must decide whether granting parole would provide a “significant public benefit” to the United States. This is a case-by-case discretionary determination, considering the totality of the circumstances of each case.\nYou\nmust\ndemonstrate through evidence that both you and your startup entity meet the rule’s threshold criteria. You\nmay\nalso provide additional supporting evidence that an approval of your application would provide a “significant public benefit” to the United States, based on your role as an entrepreneur with the startup entity.\nSuch supporting evidence may include:\nEvidence of investments from any investors (not only “qualified investors”), or government awards or grants (not only “qualified government awards or grants”). Such evidence could include bank records, wire transfers, equity purchase agreements, equity certificates, equity ledgers, or capitalization tables.\nEvidence of revenue generation.\nLetters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of your entity’s research, products, or services, and confirming that your knowledge, skills, or experience would advance your entity’s business.\nNews articles or other similar evidence that you or your startup entity have received significant attention or recognition.\nEvidence that you or your startup entity have been recently invited to participate in, are participating in, or have graduated from one or more established and reputable startup accelerators.\nPatent awards or other documents indicating that you or your startup entity are focused on developing new technologies or innovative research.\nEvidence that the startup-entity is furthering a critical and emerging technology or other science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) area important to U.S. competitiveness. To identify a critical and emerging technology field, USCIS will consider governmental, academic, and other authoritative and instructive sources, and all other evidence submitted by the applicant. One such governmental source is the Critical and Emerging Technologies List Update published by the National Science and Technology Council.\nEvidence that you have played an active and central role in the success of prior startups, such as letters from relevant government agencies, qualified investors, or established business associations with knowledge of your prior startup activities.\nAcademic degrees or other documentation indicating that you have knowledge, skills, or experience that would significantly advance your entity’s business.\nTax or payroll records, Form I-9 records, or other documents indicating that your entity has created “qualified jobs” before you filed Form I-941.\nAny other reliable evidence indicating your startup entity’s potential for growth and your ability to advance your startup entity’s business in the United States.\nWhat Happens After Approval (FAQs)\nQ. If my Form I-941 is approved and I am already in the United States, how do I receive my parole documentation? What is the process if I am outside the United States?\nA. If USCIS finds that you meet the criteria for consideration and appear to merit a favorable exercise of discretion, then your Form I-941 will be conditionally approved and the following processes will then apply:\nIf you are in the United States, you selected on your Form I-941 to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address, and we approve your Form I-941, we will also send you a multi-use Form I-512L Advance Parole document under separate cover that may arrive after your approval notice. After you receive your Form I-512L, you must depart the United States before appearing at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\nIf you are outside the United States, or you have selected on your Form I-941 to receive your travel documentation at a U.S. embassy or consulate, and you are not a Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry, we will conditionally approve your Form I-941 because you must visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to undergo biometrics collection and identity verification before you can obtain travel documentation (for example, a boarding foil). Instructions on contacting the U.S. embassy or consulate you selected on your Form I-941 will be in your Conditional Approval Notice. We will also contact the U.S. embassy or consulate to request that they schedule you for an appointment for biometrics collection and identity verification. After you receive your travel documentation, you can appear at a U.S. port of entry for a final parole determination by CBP. If you are paroled into the United States, you must contact USCIS as outlined in the instructions on your Conditional Approval Notice to receive a multi-use Form I-512L Advance Parole document, if you wish to travel outside the United States and seek parole back in during the period parole was authorized for.\nIf you are a Canadian national traveling directly from Canada to a U.S. port of entry, you may present an approved or conditionally approved Form I-941 at the U.S. port of entry without first obtaining travel documentation.\nIf circumstances do not meaningfully change after USCIS approves (or conditionally approves) your Form I-941, and DHS does not discover material information that was previously unavailable, CBP is likely to grant you parole at the port of entry.\nQ. Does the Department of State (including U.S. embassies and consulates), as distinct from DHS, have different requirements for the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. DHS is guided by the requirements of the International Entrepreneur Rule. The Department of State does not make parole determinations under this rule. USCIS first determines whether to authorize parole, and if authorized, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) makes a final parole determination at the port of entry (both USCIS and CBP are components of DHS).\nIf you are outside the United States and need to appear at a U.S. embassy or consulate to complete parole processing, the Department of State conducts additional vetting and, if no new derogatory information or identities are discovered as a result of this process, issues travel documentation on behalf of USCIS. If new information is found by the Department of State through the vetting process, the U.S. embassy or consulate will notify USCIS, which will determine if the new information affects the parole authorization.\nOnce travel documentation is issued, parole is authorized. However, advance authorization of parole by USCIS does not guarantee that you will be paroled by CBP upon your appearance at a port of entry. CBP will make a separate, discretionary determination whether to grant parole at the port of entry. If circumstances do not meaningfully change and DHS does not discover material information that was previously unavailable during the inspection process, however, CBP is likely to grant you parole at a port of entry.\nQ. If I am an applicant who has been inspected and admitted to the United States on the Visa Waiver Program, can I remain in the United States past my I-94 expiration date until my request for parole is either conditionally approved or denied?\nA. A pending or conditionally approved Form I-941 application does not authorize you, if you are present in the United States in nonimmigrant status, to remain in the United States beyond the expiration of your authorized period of stay. Remaining in the United States beyond your authorized period of stay may have immigration consequences.\nQ. Am I allowed multiple entries to the United States if I have parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. Yes, you may be allowed multiple entries to the United States if you have parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule. The maximum initial parole period is 2.5 years, which begins at the time of initial parole by CBP at a U.S. port of entry. If you then depart the United States and are granted parole upon your return at the U.S. port of entry, you may receive parole for up to the remainder of the 2.5years (the initial parole period). Any time you spend outside the United States during your parole period counts toward the maximum initial period of parole.\nIf you are in the United States when we authorize parole, and you selected on your Form I-941 to receive your parole documentation at your U.S. mailing address, we will mail you a multi-entry travel document that allows you to seek parole multiple times at a port of entry during its validity period.\nIf you are applying from abroad and receive a boarding foil from a U.S. embassy or consulate to authorize your initial parole into the United States, we will give you further instructions on how to receive a multi-use Form I-512L, Advance Parole document, after you have notified USCIS that CBP has paroled you in the United States.\nQ. What is the longest time I may remain in the United States if I receive parole through the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. You may be given an initial parole period of up to 2.5years. If approved for re-parole, you may receive up to another 2.5years, for a maximum of 5 years.\nQ. Can I change from International Entrepreneur Rule parolee to an immigrant or nonimmigrant status without leaving the United States?\nA. While in the United States in a period of parole, you may apply for classification as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, if you are eligible. However, because parole is not admission, you may be ineligible for adjustment of status or for a change of status to another nonimmigrant classification while in the United States. As a result, if your nonimmigrant or immigrant petition is approved, you may have to depart the United States to apply for a visa based on the petition approval (unless visa exempt) before traveling to a port of entry to request admission into the United States as an immigrant or nonimmigrant, as applicable.\nFor more information on immigrant and nonimmigrant options that may be available, see\nOptions for Alien Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States\n.\nSpouses and Children (FAQs)\nQ. How do my spouse and children obtain parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule?\nA. Your dependents may file Form I-131 at the same time you file Form I-941, regardless of whether they are inside or outside of the United States at the time of filing. Alternatively, your dependents may file Form I-131 after you file your Form I-941. For any I-131 or I-941 applicants outside the United States, we will send you a notice explaining where to submit biometrics in coordination with the Department of State or the international USCIS field office closest to you.\nIf you or your dependents are present in the United States and have requested to receive your parole document at the U.S. mailing address you indicated on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 18) or Form I-131 (Part 3, Item 5), you will receive a notice to appear for biometrics collection at a USCIS Application Support Center based on the mailing address you listed on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 19) or on Form I-131 (Part 1, Item 2). If you are in the United States, you must appear for your biometrics collection at an Application Support Center for your Form I-941 to be considered for approval, unless you requested to receive your parole document at the U.S. embassy or consulate.\nIf you or your dependents are currently outside of the United States and have requested to receive your parole document at the U.S. embassy or consulate you indicated on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 18) or Form I-131 (Part 3, Item 6), you will receive a notification from USCIS about processing at the U.S. embassy or consulate if we have conditionally approved your application.\nYou and your dependents do not have to be in the same location to apply for parole under the International Entrepreneur Rule. However, if the physical locations are different, the processing of the applications may differ based on location as previously described.\nQ. When will my spouse be authorized to work?\nA. Spouses who are paroled into the United States by U.S. Customs and Border Protection may immediately apply for employment authorization by filing\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n. A spouse may submit the application only after they are paroled into the United States. The spouse will not be authorized to work in the United States until the Form I-765 is approved and an Employment Authorization Document is issued.\nRe-parole (FAQs)\nQ. After the first parole period of up to 2.5 years, how do I extend my period of stay?\nA. You can apply for one additional period of re-parole for up to 2.5 years. Before the expiration of the initial period of parole, you must timely file another Form I-941, along with another Form I-131 for any spouse or children whose parole period would otherwise expire.\nQ. What are the eligibility requirements for re-parole?\nA. You are no longer required to demonstrate an ownership interest of 10 percent when applying for re-parole. Instead, as of the date USCIS adjudicates the application for re-parole, you must have retained at least a 5 percent ownership in the startup entity.\nIn general, you must demonstrate that this second grant of parole would continue to provide a significant public benefit, by establishing that during the initial parole period the startup entity has:\nReceived a qualified investment, qualified government grants or awards, or a combination of such funding, of at least $622,142 (for applications filed on or after Oct. 1, 2024);\nCreated at least 5 qualified jobs with the startup entity;\nor\nReached annual revenue in the United States of at least $622,142 (for applications filed on or after Oct. 1, 2024), and averaged at least 20 percent in annual revenue growth.\nIf the startup entity partially meets one or more of the general criteria above, you may provide alternative reliable and compelling evidence of the startup entity’s substantial potential for rapid growth and job creation.\nQ. What are my options after the 5 years of parole and re-parole?\nA. Although the International Entrepreneur Rule provides for a maximum of 5 years, the intent is for this to provide enough time for the entrepreneur to transition to a more durable status as they become eligible. For more information about both nonimmigrant and immigrant pathways, see our resources on\nOptions for Alien Entrepreneurs to Work in the United States\n.\nProcessing Times (FAQs)\nQ. How long does it take to process an International Entrepreneur Rule application?\nA. As of May 2024, we have either completed or sent a Request for Evidence for all previously filed Form I-941 applications and associated Form I-131 applications. We look forward to adjudicating new applications as expeditiously as possible.\nQ. What if I need faster processing?\nA. At present, Form I-941 is not eligible for\npremium processing\n, because under current regulations we may only provide this service for Form I-129, Form I-140, Form I-765, and Form I-539.\nYou may, however, make an\nexpedite request\n. The decision to expedite is within the sole discretion of USCIS. Expediting your case generally means that we would adjudicate your application ahead of other applications, including those who may have filed earlier, so we carefully weigh the urgency and merit of each expedite request.\nQ. Given wait times at most U.S. embassies and consulates around the world, are USCIS and the Department of State taking any steps to ensure timely processing?\nA. We are coordinating closely with the Department of State to ensure timely and efficient processing of International Entrepreneur Rule applicants who have opted for processing abroad and have received a Conditional Approval. Processing at a U.S. embassy or consulate may occur within weeks after we issue a Conditional Approval. Biometrics submission and boarding foil processing also depend on the availability of the applicant to appear at the U.S. embassy or consulate for biometrics collection and identity verification.\nTo avoid processing delays, please make sure that your contact information, including your mailing address, e-mail address, and phone number, are correct on your Form I-941 or Form I-131 and that you provide timely updates to USCIS of any changes in your mailing address by following\nthese instructions\n. A U.S. embassy or consulate may try to contact you by phone or e-mail. If you are an entrepreneur, you may provide your phone number and e-mail address on Form I-941. If you are a spouse or child of an entrepreneur, you may provide your phone number on Form I-131 in the designated section in “Part 3, Processing Information” and your e-mail address in Part 3 in the blank space underneath the “Phone Number.”\nAdditionally, please make sure that you select the correct location where you will receive your travel documents, as your response to this question will also determine where the U.S. government will collect your biometrics. If you are an entrepreneur, you may select your processing location on Form I-941 (Part 1, Item 18). If you are the spouse or child of an entrepreneur, you may select your processing location on Form I-131 (Part 3, Item 6).\nQ. How is processing affected if I have chosen to receive my parole document at my U.S. mailing address?\nA. If you are in the United States and have opted in Form I-941 to receive your parole document at a U.S. mailing address (Part 1, Item 18), you will receive a notice to appear for a biometrics appointment at an Application Support Center based on your U.S. mailing address (Part 1, Item 19). You must appear for your biometrics appointment for us to consider your Form I-941 application for approval. To avoid delays, please ensure you notify us of any address change within the U.S. by following\nthese instructions\n. If applicable, please ensure that you include the apartment, floor, or suite number of your U.S. mailing address. Please also provide any “In Care Of Name” information, if any.\nIMPORTANT: If you opted to receive your parole document at your U.S. mailing address, please note that the I-512L Advance Parole document is a secure document that will only be sent to you at the U.S. mailing address you provided in your Form I-941 application. If you are represented by an attorney, an extra copy will not be sent to your attorney.

      "content": "Permanent Workers\nEmployment-Based Visas\nApproximately 140,000 immigrant visas are available each fiscal year for aliens (and their spouses and children) who seek to immigrate based on their job skills. These employment-based immigrant visas are allocated among 5 preference categories that are summarized in the chart below. If you have the right combination of skills, education, and/or work experience and are otherwise eligible, you may be able to live permanently in the United States.\nSome immigrant visa preference categories require you to have a permanent job offer from a U.S. employer. This employer will be considered your sponsor/petitioner and will file an immigrant petition with USCIS on your behalf. If no job offer is required, you may file a petition on your own behalf.\nFor more information, see\nEmployment-Based Adjustment of Status FAQs\n.\nLabor Certification\nFor the second and third preference categories (see chart below), before the U.S. employer can file an immigrant petition with USCIS, the employer must generally obtain a labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The labor certification verifies the following:\nThere are insufficient available, qualified, able, and willing U.S. workers to fill the position being offered at the prevailing wage rate or higher; and\nHiring a foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\nIn these cases, the immigrant petition must include a signed Form ETA-9089, Application for Permanent Employment Certification, approved by DOL, or, for labor certification applications filed on or after June 1, 2023, using DOL’s Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG) system, an approved and signed Form ETA-9089, Final Determination – Permanent Employment Certification Approval (Final Determination).\nFor certain occupations, referred to as Schedule A occupations, a DOL-approved labor certification is not required because DOL has already determined there are not sufficient U.S. workers for those occupations. Currently, DOL has designated 2 groups of occupations under Schedule A. Group I includes professional nurses and physical therapists. Group II includes beneficiaries with exceptional ability in the sciences or arts (including college and university teachers) and immigrants of exceptional ability in the performing arts. Immigrant petitions for these occupations must be accompanied by a completed, uncertified Form ETA-9089, including all applicable appendices, a signed Final Determination, and a valid prevailing wage determination tracking number in Section E, Item 1 of the Form ETA-9089 (application for Schedule A designation).\nIn addition, for the second preference category, an immigrant petition may request a waiver of the job offer, and thus the labor certification requirement, because it is in the national interest of the United States. National interest waiver petitions must be accompanied by a completed Form ETA-9089, Appendix A and a signed Form ETA-9089, Final Determination.\nFor more information on labor certifications and the Schedule A and national interest waiver exceptions, see the\nSecond Preference EB-2\nand\nThird Preference EB-3\nwebpages.\nPermanent Worker Visa Preference Categories\nPreferences\nGeneral Description\nIndividual Labor Certification Required?\nFirst Preference EB-1\nThis preference is reserved for persons of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics; outstanding professors or researchers; and certain multinational executives and managers.\nNo\nSecond Preference EB-2\nThis preference is reserved for persons who are members of the professions holding advanced degrees or for persons with exceptional ability in the arts, sciences, or business.\nYes, unless the Form I-140 petition is accompanied by an application for Schedule A designation or a request for a national interest waiver.\nThird Preference EB-3\nThis preference is reserved for professionals, skilled workers, and other workers. (See\nThird Preference EB-3\npage for further definition of these job classifications.)\nYes, unless the Form I-140 petition is accompanied by an application for Schedule A designation.\nFourth Preference EB-4\nThis preference is reserved for “special immigrants,” which includes certain religious workers, employees of U.S. foreign service posts, retired employees of international organizations, alien minors who are wards of courts in the United States, and other classes of aliens.\nNo\nFifth Preference EB-5\nThis preference is reserved for business investors who invest $1,050,000 or $800,000 (if the investment is made in a targeted employment area) in a new commercial enterprise that employs at least 10 full-time U.S. workers.\nNo\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n01/24/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

However, some of the content may still be useful, so we have archived the page.\nThank you for visiting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) online and reviewing our website privacy policy. USCIS is a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Our privacy policy explains how we handle the personally identifiable information (PII) that you provide to us when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. PII includes information that is personal in nature and which may be used to identify you. You may provide PII to us when you email us or send a request for information, when you fill out a questionnaire or satisfaction survey, when you participate in a research study, etc. We do not require you to register or provide PII to visit our website. We do collect some technical information that does not include PII when you visit to make your visit seamless. The section below explains how we handle and collect information when you visit\nwww.uscis.gov\n.\nThe PII you provide on a DHS website will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it. We will protect your information consistent with the principles of the\nPrivacy Act of 1974\n, the\nE-Government Act of 2002\n, and the\nFederal Records Act\n.\nPersonally Identifiable Information\nAs a general rule, DHS does not collect PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving DHS your permission to use the information for a specific, stated purpose. However, not providing certain information may prevent us from providing you with the service you desire.\nIf you choose to provide us with PII on a DHS website, through such methods as completing a web form, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or service you have requested. The information we may receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.\nWe only share the PII you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give your PII to any private organizations. We never collect information for commercial marketing.\nIf we store your PII in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.), so that we may contact you, we will safeguard the information you provide to us in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). The Privacy Act requires all public-facing sites or forms that request PII to prominently and conspicuously display a privacy notice.\nThe notice must address the following criteria:\nLegal authorization to collect information about you;\nPurpose for which the information will be used;\nRoutine uses for disclosure of information outside of the Department of Homeland Security;\nWhether your providing the information is voluntary or mandatory under law; and\nResults if you choose to not provide the requested information.\nFor the general contact information that may be submitted through\nwww.uscis.gov\n, we have completed a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and System of Records Notice (SORN) providing details about the privacy protections and redress options available for the contact information we collect from the public. We may use this information to provide you with information and to perform various administrative tasks. For further information, please reference the privacy compliance documentation below:\nDHS/ALL/PIA-006\nDepartment of Homeland Security General Contact Lists  (PDF)\nPrivacy Impact Assessment (April 25, 2019)\nDHS/ALL-002\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Mailing and Other Lists\nSystem of Records Notice (November 25, 2008, 73 FR 71659)\nEmail Communications\nMany of our programs and websites allow you to send us email messages. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry. We will only send you general information via email. You should be reminded that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. Therefore, we suggest that you do not send sensitive PII (such as your Social Security number) to us via email. If your intended email communication is sensitive, e.g., it includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or Social Security number, you should instead send it by U.S. mail. You may also submit data through a secure program website, if available.\nElectronic mail messages that meet the definition of records in the\nFederal Records Act\n(44 U.S.C. § 3101) are covered under the same disposition schedule as all other federal records. This means that emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for varying periods of time if those emails meet the definition of federal records. Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer needed.\nInformation Collected and Stored Automatically\nWhen you browse through any website, certain information about your visit can be collected. We automatically collect the following types of information about your visit:\nDomain from which you access the Internet;\nIP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when navigating the internet);\nOperating system and information about the device or browser used when visiting the site;\nDate and time of your visit;\nContent you visited or downloaded; and,\nWebsite (such as google.com or bing.com) or referral source (email notice or social media site) that connected you to the website.\nDHS uses a variety of different web measurement software tools.\nDHS uses Google Analytics measurement software to collect the information listed above. The data are automatically sent to Google’s system and the system immediately aggregates the data. Neither DHS nor Google ever have access to the specifics of your particular site visits. The staff can only see the aggregate data from all users for a particular time period.\nDHS gathers this information to improve our websites and has chosen to not share the aggregate data with Google. We may use the aggregated data to share with our partners and contractors to help improve visitor experiences.\nDHS also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors. DHS uses the Foresee Results American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey to obtain feedback and data on visitors’ satisfaction with DHS websites. This survey does not collect PII. Participation in the survey is voluntary. If you decline to take the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources on the website as those who take the survey. Answers to the survey help us improve our website to make it easier to use and more responsive to the needs of our visitors.\nDHS staff conduct analyses and reports on the aggregated data from the ACSI survey. The reports are only available to website managers, members of their communications and web teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.\nDHS retains the data from Google Analytics, and ACSI survey results only as long as required by law or needed to support the mission of the DHS websites.\nOmnichannel Survey\nPaperwork Reduction Act Statement\nAn agency may not conduct or sponsor an information collection and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated at 5 minute per response. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to: External Affairs Directorate, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 5900 Capital Gateway Drive – Mail Stop 2040, Camp Springs, MD 20588-0009. OMB No. 1615-0121. Do not return a completed form to this address.\nDHS Privacy Notice\nAUTHORITIES: The information requested on this survey, and the associated evidence, is collected under the Immigration and Nationality Act sections [101, 103, 221,245.; Public Law 103-62 “Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA);” Public Law 111-352 “Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010”; Public Law 107-347 “E-Government Act of 2002”; 31 U.S. Code § 1115, “Federal Government and agency performance plans”.\nPURPOSE: The primary purpose for providing the requested information on this survey is to provide USCIS with the feedback to make improvements to the services provided to the public.\nDISCLOSURE: The information you provide is voluntary.\nHow the Department Uses Cookies\nThe Office of Management and Budget Memo\nM-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies (PDF)\nallows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.\nWhen you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a \"cookie\" to place on your computer. Placing cookie text allows websites to “remember” visitors’ preferences, surfing patterns and behavior while they are connected.\nThe cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages. Cookies from our web pages only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect any personal information about you.\nThere are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.\nSession Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as \"Usage Tier 1-Single Session.” The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.\"\nPersistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies to enable Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning visitors to our site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to our sites for six months. We also use persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey. The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as \"Usage Tier 2-Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected.\"\nIf you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can\nopt out or disable cookies\nin your browser. You will still have access to all information and resources at DHS websites. However, turning off cookies may affect the functioning of some DHS websites. Be aware that disabling cookies in your browser will affect cookie usage at all other websites you visit as well.\nFor additional information about the DHS’s use of Google Analytics, please see our privacy impact assessment, DHS/ALL/PIA-033\nGoogle Analytics  (PDF)\n(June 9, 2011).\nThird-Party Websites and Applications\nDHS uses social media websites and other kinds of third-party websites. We use social media websites to engage in dialogue, share information and media, and collaborate with the public. We may also use these websites to make information and services widely available, while promoting transparency and accountability, as a service for those seeking information about or services from DHS. The privacy policies for approved social media platforms are linked to the right of this privacy policy. We have have also published two Privacy Impact Assessments detailing our use of social media:\nDHS/ALL/PIA-031\nUse of Social Networking Interactions and Applications Communications/Outreach/Public Dialogue  (PDF)\n(September 16, 2010)\nDHS/ALL/PIA-036\nUse of Unidirectional Social Media Applications  (PDF)\n(March 8, 2011)\nDHS does not use third-party websites to solicit and collect PII from individuals. DHS will not transmit or store any PII collected by the third-party website; no PII will be disclosed, sold or transferred to any other entity outside DHs, unless required for law enforcement purposes or by statute consistent with the Privacy Act.\nSite Security\nDHS takes the security of all PII very seriously. We take precautions to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we collect at this site. Such measures include access controls designed to limit access to the information to the extent necessary to accomplish our mission. We also employ various security technologies to protect the information stored on our systems. We routinely test our security measures to ensure that they remain operational and effective.\nFor site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.\nExcept for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.\nUnauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.\nInteraction with Children Online\nDHS is committed to the protection of children’s online privacy. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. If a DHS website intends to collect information from children under 13 years old, COPPA-required information and instructions will be provided by the specific web page that collects information about the child. The web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.\nVisiting Other Websites\nOur website contains links to international agencies, private organizations, and some commercial entities. These websites are not within our control and may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility polices. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the policies of that site.

Having an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766/EAD) is one way to prove that you are authorized to work in the United States for a specific time period.\nTo request an EAD, you generally must file\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n. You will need to apply for an EAD if you:\nAre authorized to work in the United States because of your immigration status or circumstances (for example, you are an\nasylee\n,\nrefugee\n, or U nonimmigrant) and need evidence of that employment authorization, or\nAre required to apply for permission to work (that is, you need to request employment authorization itself) because:\nYou have a pending\nForm I-485\n, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.\nYou have a pending\nForm I-589\n, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal.\nYou have a nonimmigrant status or circumstance that allows you to be in the United States but does not allow you to work in the United States without first seeking permission from USCIS (such as an F-1 or M-1 student).\nYou do not need to apply for an EAD if you are a lawful permanent resident. Your Green Card (Form I-551, Permanent Resident Card) is evidence of your employment authorization. You also do not need to apply for an EAD if you have a nonimmigrant status that authorizes you to work for a specific employer incident to your status (for example, you are an H-1B, L-1B, O, or P nonimmigrant).\nRenew an EAD\nIf you remain eligible to apply for employment authorization or remain employment authorized incident to your status or circumstances, but your EAD will be expiring or has expired, you should file for a renewal EAD by submitting a new Form I-765 and filing fee (if required), unless a fee waiver is requested and approved.\nWe encourage you to file your renewal application as soon as possible once your EAD is within 180 days of its expiration date to reduce the possibility of a gap in your employment authorization and/or documentation.\nReplace an EAD\nIf Your EAD Is Lost, Stolen or Destroyed\nIf your EAD is lost, stolen or destroyed, you may request a replacement EAD by filing a new Form I-765 and filing fee (if required), unless a fee waiver is requested and approved.
