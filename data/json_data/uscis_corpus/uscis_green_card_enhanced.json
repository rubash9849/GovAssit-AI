      "content": "Green Card Processes and Procedures\nEach Green Card category have specific steps and procedures to follow. Listed below are some general processes and procedures to help you apply either while in the United States (known as “adjustment of status”) or while outside the United States (known as “consular processing”).\nPage Title\nSummary\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\nDetermine if you are eligible for permanent resident status. Review the eligibility requirements needed before applying for your Green Card.\nAdjustment of Status\nAdjusting your status to a permanent resident is the process immigrants use to get a Green Card while in the United States.\nConsular Processing\nConsular processing is the method immigrants use to get their Green Card when outside the United States or when ineligible to adjust status in the United States.\nConcurrent Filing\nWhen getting a Green Card through employment, family, or as a special immigrant, someone may need to file a petition for you. Concurrent filing is generally when the immigrant petition is filed at the same time you file your application to get a Green Card. Learn what concurrent filing is and what categories are eligible to concurrently file.\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\nIn general, a visa must be available for you before you can apply for a Green Card. In some categories, visas are always available, while in others, there are a limited number. Priority dates are given to immigrants waiting in line to get an immigrant visa and determine when a visa becomes available. Learn how to tell if a visa is available to you.\nTravel Documents\nLearn more about if and when you can travel outside the United States after applying for a Green Card or once you have a Green Card. You can also learn how to apply for advance parole, a Refugee Travel Document, and a re-entry permit.\nEmployment Authorization Document\nLearn more about if you are eligible for work authorization in the United States and how to apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\nImmigration Medical Examinations\nMost applications for a Green Card require a medical exam. Learn about who must complete a medical exam and the specific forms and procedures that you must follow.\nAffidavit of Support\nAn affidavit of support is a form that a sponsor files on your behalf when you are applying for a Green Card or immigrant visa. It is required for some (but not all) categories of immigrants before they can become a permanent resident of the United States. The purpose of the form is to show you have the financial means to live in the United States without needing welfare or financial benefits from the U.S. government.\nPublic Charge\nTo get a Green Card, most immigrants must show that they will not become a public charge. Learn more about\npublic charge\n.\nChild Status Protection Act\nYour age can determine whether you are eligible for a Green Card as a “child.” The Child Status Protection Act, often referred to as CSPA, allows certain children who have aged out (become 21 years or older) after an immigrant petition has been filed to still be eligible for a Green Card through their parents.\nTransfer of Underlying Basis\nAn adjustment of status applicant occasionally prefers to have their pending application considered under a different immigrant category. For more information about transferring, see the\nUSCIS Policy Manual\n.\nTo transfer the basis of your pending adjustment of status application to a different eligibility category, you generally must submit a written request to the USCIS office with jurisdiction over the application.  USCIS has also established a new location that should be used for submitting transfer requests between employment-based categories.  See\nGreen Card for Employment-Based Immigrants, Transfer of Underlying Basis\n.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n10/19/2022\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Travel Documents\nIf you wish to return to the United States lawfully after traveling outside the United States, you generally must have a:\nValid entry document, such as a Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) or nonimmigrant visa; or\nValid and unexpired travel document.\nThe type of document you need varies depending on your immigration status (including lawful permanent resident status) or if you have a pending immigration benefit request.\nYou generally need to apply for and obtain a travel document\nbefore\nyou leave the United States. Before planning travel, please consider\nUSCIS processing times\n. If you have an urgent need to travel outside the United States, see our\nExpedite Request\nand\nEmergency Travel\npages for additional information.\nFile\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, to request travel documents, including:\nAdvance parole document for aliens in the United States seeking to return after temporary travel abroad (including advance permission to travel for Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) long-term residents);\nRefugee travel document;\nReentry permit; or\nTemporary Protected Status travel authorization.\nIf you are already outside the United States and need to return, but do not have your reentry permit, Green Card, advance parole document, or Temporary Protected Status travel authorization document because it was lost, stolen, or destroyed, see Form I-131A, Application for Carrier Documentation.\nCaution\nTravel outside of the United States may have severe immigration-related consequences.\nAdmission or parole into the United States is not guaranteed even if you have the appropriate documents. You are still subject to immigration inspection or examination at a port of entry to determine whether you may be admitted or paroled into the country and whether you are eligible for the immigration status you seek.\nAdditional cautions for people in certain circumstances are summarized below.\nIf you are a nonimmigrant\nIf you have been admitted as a nonimmigrant and have filed\nForm I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status\n, to change to a different nonimmigrant status, we generally will consider your Form I-539 abandoned if you leave the United States before we make a decision on your application, though there are some exceptions.  Having an advance parole document does\nnot\nprevent abandonment of the change of status application. When you return to the United States, you are likely to be denied admission if your current status has expired.\nIf you have a pending Green Card application\nIn general, if you are applying for adjustment of status (a Green Card) and leave the United States without the appropriate travel documentation (for example, an advance parole document), you may not be allowed to reenter the United States when you return. Even if you are allowed to reenter, you may be found to have abandoned your pending application for adjustment of status.\nIf you have unlawful presence or a removal order\nIf you have accrued unlawful presence while in the United States or have a removal order, then you may be found inadmissible if you seek admission after a departure from the United States, even if you have a travel document.  We follow the Board of Immigration Appeals decision in\nMatter of Arrabally and Yerrabelly\n, which held that travel on advance parole does not constitute a “departure” for purposes of triggering the 10-year unlawful presence bar under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(II) for applicants for adjustment of status. We also apply this analysis to INA § 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I) and to individuals with TPS who travel on TPS travel authorization.  For more information, please see\nSection 212(a)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\nand the\nUnlawful Presence and Inadmissibility\npage.\nAdvance Parole Document\nAdvance parole allows you to travel back to the United States without applying for a visa. A transportation company (airlines) can accept an advance parole document instead of a visa as proof that you are authorized to travel to the United States. An advance parole document does not replace your passport.\nPlease note that having an advance parole document does not guarantee that you will be allowed to reenter the United States. At the airport or border, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer will make the final decision about whether to allow you to reenter the United States.\nAdvance parole is most commonly used when someone has a pending:\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or to Adjust Status\n: If you depart the U.S. while your Form I-485 is pending without first obtaining advance parole, USCIS will deny your case unless you fit into a narrow exception for people with certain nonimmigrant statuses.\nForm I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal\n: If you are an asylum applicant and you intend to travel outside the United States and return, you must apply for and receive advance parole. If you leave the United States without first obtaining advance parole, we will assume that you have abandoned your asylum application.\nFor information on how to apply for advance parole, go to our\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\npage.\nRefugee Travel Document\nUSCIS issues refugee travel documents to people with refugee or asylum status and to lawful permanent residents who obtained their Green Cards based on their refugee or asylee status.\nYou must have a refugee travel document to return to the United States if you:\nHave refugee or asylee status but are not a lawful permanent resident (Green Card holder); or\nAre a derivative asylee or refugee.\nIf you do not obtain a refugee travel document before you leave the U.S., you may be unable to re-enter the United States or you may be placed in removal proceedings before an immigration judge.\nFor information on how to apply for a refugee travel document, go to our\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\npage.\nReentry Permit\nPermanent or conditional residents should apply for a re-entry permit if they will be outside the United States for one year or more. While it is valid, a re-entry permit allows you to apply for admission to the U.S. without having to obtain a returning resident visa from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Go to our\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\npage for information on how to apply.\nTemporary Protected Status Travel Document\nTravel authorization for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries allows you to travel back to the United States and, if you are eligible, be inspected and admitted into TPS. A transportation company (such as an airline) can accept a TPS travel authorization document instead of a visa as proof that you are authorized to travel to the United States. A TPS travel authorization document does not replace your passport.\nPlease note that having a TPS travel authorization document does not guarantee that you will be allowed to reenter the United States. At the airport or border, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer will make the final decision about whether to allow you to reenter the United States.\nIf we are still adjudicating your application for TPS and you wish to travel outside the United States, you may request advance parole.\nFor information on how to apply for TPS travel authorization, go to our\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, page.\nCarrier Documentation\nCarrier documentation allows an airline or other transportation carrier to board permanent residents who have temporarily been outside the United States and whose Green Card or re-entry permit has been lost, stolen or destroyed. If you are a permanent resident in this situation, you\nmay\nneed to file a Form I-131A. Go to the\nForm I-131A, Application for Travel Document (Carrier Documentation)\nfor more information.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n01/24/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Adjustment of Status\nAdjustment of status is the process that you can use to apply for lawful permanent resident status (also known as applying for a Green Card) when you are present in the United States. This means that you may get a Green Card without having to return to your home country to complete visa processing.\nIf you are outside of the United States, you must obtain your visa abroad through\nconsular processing\n.\nSteps for Adjustment of Status\n1. Determine if you are eligible to apply for a Green Card\nU.S. immigration laws provide a variety of ways for people to apply for a Green Card. The eligibility requirements for adjustment of status may vary depending on the immigrant category you are applying under. The first step in the adjustment of status process is to determine if you fit into a specific immigrant category.\nGo to our\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\npage to see all the possible categories you can apply under. Once you find your immigrant category, you can then go to the specific page that lists what the eligibility requirements are.\n2. You or someone else must file an immigrant petition for you (if applicable)\nMost people who apply for a Green Card will need to complete at least two forms—an immigrant petition and a Green Card application. Someone else usually must file the petition for you (often referred to as sponsoring or petitioning for you), although you may be eligible to file for yourself in some cases. Here are the most common forms:\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition\nForm I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal\nOther petitions include:\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\nForm I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur\nForm I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status\nForm I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant\nMost categories require you to have an approved immigrant petition before you can file a\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n. However, some categories may allow you to file your Form I-485 at the same time that the immigrant petition is filed or while the immigrant petition is pending. This is called “concurrent filing.” For more information on concurrent filing, see our\nConcurrent Filing page\nor the specific page for your eligibility category.\nSome categories do not require an underlying immigrant petition (for example, Cuban Adjustment Act). Go to our\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\npage to determine if an immigrant petition is or is not required for each category.\n3. Check visa availability (if applicable)\nIn general, you may not file your Form I-485 until a visa is available in your category. For information on visa availability, see the\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\npage, the\nAdjustment of Status Filing Charts\n, and the Department of State website to view the\nVisa Bulletin\n.\nFor exceptions to the visa availability requirement, please check your specific immigrant category for more information.\n4. File Form I-485\nIf you are in the United States and are eligible for adjustment of status, you may file a Form I-485. Go to the\nForm I-485 instructions\nand\nthe web page for your immigrant category\nfor instructions on how to complete your application and properly file it with USCIS. Go to the\nDirect Filing Addresses for Form I-485\npage to see where you should file your application.\nIf you are applying to adjust your status to lawful permanent resident under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), you must complete both Form I‑485 and\nForm I-485 Supplement A, Adjustment of Status Under Section 245(i)\n.\n5. Go to your Application Support Center appointment\nAfter you file your Form I-485, we will mail you a notice for your biometrics services appointment at a local Application Support Center (ASC) to provide your fingerprints, photograph, and/or signature. The notice will include the date, time, and location of the appointment. We use your biometrics to verify your identity and conduct required background and security checks.\nAt your ASC appointment, we will ask you to sign an acknowledgment certifying, for example, that you reviewed all the information in your application and that all the information in your application was complete, true, and correct at the time you filed it. If you do not sign the acknowledgment or miss your ASC appointment without properly notifying us and requesting that we reschedule your appointment, we may deny your Form I-485.\nGo to\nPreparing for Your Biometrics Services Appointment\nfor more information.\n6. Go to your interview (if applicable)\nUSCIS officials will review your case to determine whether an\ninterview\nis necessary. If we schedule you for an interview, you will be required to appear at a USCIS office to answer questions under oath or affirmation regarding your Form I‑485. We will send you a notice with the date, time, and location of the interview.\nWhen you come to your interview, you (and the family member who filed the immigrant petition for you, if applicable) must bring originals of all documentation submitted with the Form I-485 application. This includes passports, official travel documents, and Form I-94, whether or not they are expired.\n7. Respond to request for additional evidence (if applicable)\nWe may send you a request for additional evidence if:\nYou did not submit all the required evidence;\nThe evidence you submitted is no longer valid; or\nThe officer needs more information to determine your eligibility.\nThe request will indicate what evidence is needed. The request will also tell you where to send the evidence and the date by when you must respond to the request. If you do not respond to the request timely, the officer may deny your Form I-485. Not all applicants receive a request for additional evidence.\n8. Check your case status\nYou may\ncheck your case status online\nor call our\nUSCIS Contact Center\nat 800-375-5283 to check the status of your Form I-485. For people who are deaf, hard of hearing or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833. Be prepared to provide the USCIS representative with specific information about your application, such as your receipt number, A-Number, name, and date of birth.\n9. Receive a decision\nWhen USCIS decides on your application, we will send you a written decision notice.\nIf we approve your application, you generally will receive an approval notice first and then receive your actual Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) a little later.\nIf we deny your application, the decision notice will tell you the reason(s) why your application is denied and whether you may appeal the decision. Generally, you cannot appeal the decision to deny an adjustment of status application. Even if you cannot appeal the denial, you may still be eligible to file a motion to reopen or reconsider. Both appeals and motions are filed on\nForm I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion\n. For more information, see our\nQuestions and Answers: Appeals and Motions\npage.\nChange of Address\nIf you change your address, you must tell us within 10 days of moving to the new address.

In\nMatter of O. Vazquez,\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) found that the term “sought to acquire” was ambiguous and that the alien might also satisfy the provision “by showing that there are extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond their control.”\n[1]\nHowever, neither\nMatter of O. Vasquez\nnor other authorities address how to treat the visa availability periods of less than 1 year that coincide with an alien’s period of extraordinary circumstances for purposes of\nINA 203(h)\n. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, USCIS provides the applicant with another 1-year period to seek to acquire when the visa next becomes available again solely to ensure that the applicant has the benefit of the entire 1-year period afforded by Congress under\nINA 203(h)\n.\n[2]\nOnce the visa next becomes available, the applicant’s Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) age is calculated based on this next visa availability date.\n[3]\nUSCIS has not previously issued policy guidance regarding extraordinary circumstances and the unavailability of a visa.\nIn accordance with\nMatter of O. Vazquez,\nif the applicant establishes that extraordinary circumstances prevented the potential applicant from timely filing an adjustment of status application or otherwise seeking to acquire LPR status when a visa is available for less than a year, then it is reasonable for the agency to find that the applicant satisfied the sought to acquire provision during that period. Because USCIS had not previously addressed the issue of extraordinary circumstances and failure to seek to acquire prior to unavailability, the foregoing policy is new guidance. Accordingly, USCIS is supplementing its interpretation here.\nIf USCIS were to account for extraordinary circumstances only during periods when the visa was available for a continuous 1-year period, but not during periods when the visa was available for less than 1 year, then USCIS would have to use the next visa availability date for purposes of an age calculation.\n[4]\nThis would be the case even though it was beyond the control of the applicant to file earlier because of extraordinary circumstances. USCIS believes such an interpretation of the sought to acquire requirement, considering the statutory scheme limiting visa availability and the potential for visa retrogression in preference cases, does not comport with the interpretation of “sought to acquire” as provided in the BIA’s decision in\nMatter of O. Vazquez\n.\nBy issuing this guidance, USCIS is clarifying the interplay between the statutory scheme governing visa limitations and the BIA’s interpretation of “sought to acquire.” Through this guidance, USCIS provides new, clear instructions and ensures a uniform approach within the agency. The updated guidance, moreover, is consistent with the purpose of the CSPA, to protect certain beneficiaries from losing eligibility for immigrant visas due to aging out. USCIS also has considered the extent to which this policy update may adversely impact interested parties or upset reliance interests. Given that the guidance is a product of an interplay between statutory provisions governing visa limitation and binding BIA precedent, and the fact that USCIS previously did not have any guidance on the issue of a visa becoming unavailable during the first year of availability, the existence of extraordinary circumstances during the initial period of availability, and failure to seek to acquire during the initial period of availability, USCIS believes interested parties will have only developed serious reliance interests, if at all, based on the holding of\nMatter of O. Vazquez\n.\nUSCIS recognizes that given the visa allocation scheme provided by Congress, this new policy guidance means that some aliens may be eligible for CSPA benefits because they will be considered a child based on an earlier visa availability date, which in turn may cause other visa applicants to wait longer for an available visa. However, the current statutory scheme which permits certain individuals to be considered children for immigration purposes already results in other aliens having to wait longer for a visa to become available. Given that the updated guidance aims to ensures a uniform interpretation of law and provide guidance in an area that has not been expressly addressed, the implications of this guidance are generally likely to adversely affect the same proportion of individuals as those impacted by USCIS’ current implementation of CSPA. USCIS considers this impact to be outweighed by the benefits of avoiding family separation so that eligible aliens may adjust status with their parents. For these reasons, USCIS believes that, if there are any, reliance interests do not outweigh the benefits provided by this updated guidance.\nTherefore, USCIS believes that\nMatter of O. Vazquez\nis best implemented by considering an applicant to satisfy the sought to acquire provision when the visa is available for less than 1 year if the alien did not apply during that period but the period is covered by extraordinary circumstances.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nSee\nMatter of O. Vazquez\n(PDF)\n, 25 I&N Dec. 817, 820 (BIA 2012) (“Moreover, an alien might satisfy the ‘sought to acquire’ provision by showing that there are other extraordinary circumstances in the case, particularly those where the failure to timely file was due to circumstances beyond the alien’s control.”).\n[^ 2]\nSee\nMatter of O.

That Visa Bulletin chart in effect corresponded to what is currently the “Final Action Dates” chart. In October 2015, DOS began publishing two charts in the DOS Visa Bulletin consisting of a “Dates for Filing” chart (which notifies beneficiaries when they may assemble and submit required documents to the DOS National Visa Center (NVC)) and a Final Action Dates chart (which informs when a visa is authorized for issuance).\nBetween the enactment of the CSPA in 2002 and October 2015, it was understood that an immigrant visa “bec[ame] available” for the CSPA age calculation based on the chart published in the Visa Bulletin now known as the Final Action Dates chart. On May 23, 2018, following the publication of the two charts in the Visa Bulletin, USCIS issued policy guidance clarifying that it continued to only consider a visa available for the CSPA age calculation based on the Final Action Dates chart.\n[4]\nOn February 14, 2023, USCIS issued updated policy guidance that a visa becomes available to calculate CSPA age for an alien at the same time USCIS considers a visa immediately available for accepting and processing the adjustment of status application.\n[5]\nWhen USCIS determined there were more immigrant visas available for a fiscal year than there were known aliens for such visas, and USCIS designated the Dates for Filing chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin\n[6]\nto determine eligibility for filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Dates for Filing chart when calculating the alien’s CSPA age. When USCIS designated the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin for use by aliens when filing adjustment of status applications, then USCIS used the Final Action Dates when calculating the alien’s CSPA age.\n[7]\nNeither CSPA nor DHS regulations define when a visa becomes available for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under\nINA 203(h)\n, and there are no precedent federal court decisions or published administrative decisions on this issue. USCIS carefully considered the February 14, 2023 interpretation of\nINA 203(h)\n, including in light of the Supreme Court decision in\nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n(\nLoper Bright\n).\n[8]\nUSCIS believes that utilizing the Final Action Date is the most faithful alignment with the statutory text of\nINA 203(h)\n[9]\nand the structure of\nINA 203\nas a whole,\n[10]\nand effectuates the purpose of\nINA 203(h)\nas recognized by courts.\n[11]\nContrasted with\nINA 201(f)(1)\n, which broadly freezes the age of certain immediate relatives on the date of filing the immigrant petition,\nINA 203(h)(1)\npermits only certain preference aliens to be deemed a child for immigration purposes based on a particular formula which, when enacted, was centered around when a visa could actually be allocated and used for adjustment of status or immigrant visa processing. For adjustment cases, the application of the provisions of\nINA 203(h)\nis generally a retrospective analysis conducted at the time of final adjustment adjudication alone as opposed to eligibility to file under\nINA 245(a)\n.\nFurthermore, using the Final Action Date chart is most consistent with the longstanding interpretation of\nINA 203(h)\nthat USCIS had relied on prior to February 14, 2023, and is closest to the contemporaneous understanding of visa availability at the time Congress enacted CSPA. Interpretations issued contemporaneously with the statute, and which have remained consistent over time, are especially useful in determining the statute’s meaning.\n[12]\nWhen Congress enacted CSPA, it did so with the knowledge and understanding of existing law and processes provided by the agencies within their authorities and expertise, including the operation of the DOS Visa Bulletin.\n[13]\nDOS and USCIS utilized the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation under\nINA 203(h)\nuntil the February 14, 2023 policy change, and this interpretation had remained consistent for over 20 years.\nFinally, by returning to the Final Action Dates chart for purposes of the CSPA age calculation,\n[14]\nDHS ensures a uniform interpretation of\nINA 203(h)\nacross government agencies and establishes parity for CSPA age calculations for aliens who apply for adjustment of status with USCIS and immigrant visas with DOS. After the February 14, 2023 policy update, USCIS and DOS interpreted\nINA 203(h)\ninconsistently, which resulted in inconsistent treatment of aliens who applied for adjustment of status in the United States and aliens who applied for an immigrant visa with DOS abroad. Even after implementing the October 2015 changes to the Visa Bulletin, DOS considered the Final Action Dates chart of the DOS Visa Bulletin as the only dates that should be used to calculate the CSPA age for aliens who apply for an immigrant visa.\n[15]\nTherefore, an alien filing for adjustment of status in the United States may have been considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA when USCIS designates the earlier dates in the Dates for Filing chart while an alien who must apply for an immigrant visa outside the United States may have been ineligible to immigrate as a child if his or her calculated CSPA age is 21 or older when a visa became available according to the later dates in the Final Action Dates chart.\n[16]\nUSCIS is cognizant that the February 14, 2023 policy may have engendered reliance interests, and USCIS has assessed the impact of this policy change on aliens, including aliens with a pending adjustment of status application. This policy change means that the alien could have a visa immediately available for purposes of filing the adjustment of status application while a visa may not have become available under the Final Action Date chart for purposes of the CSPA calculation, if USCIS designates the Dates of Filing chart for purposes of filing adjustment of status applications in a given month. In this circumstance, the alien may file the adjustment application and pay the fee without knowing for certain whether he or she would be considered a child for immigration purposes under CSPA and, thus, whether the alien would be eligible for adjustment of status application once a visa is available to calculate his or her CSPA age. That was one of the triggering reasons for the February 14, 2023 policy. However, as explained, the February 14, 2023 policy has neither been longstanding nor are these considerations of such nature that they would be engendering significant reliance interests for aliens who are impacted by the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, specifically, aliens who have not yet filed adjustment of status applications.\n[17]\nEvery alien filing a request with USCIS assumes the risk that he or she may be ineligible for the benefit under U.S. immigration laws, and thus, may have paid a USCIS fee without obtaining the benefit. Aliens seeking eligibility to adjust status believing that they are considered a child under CSPA are no different. The short duration of the policy, and the lack of associated rights related to the February 14, 2023 guidance for aliens who file adjustment of status applications after the policy guidance that is effective on August 15, 2025, the fact that such aliens have not paid a fee for an adjustment of status application, and the absence of any guarantee that the alien would be eligible to remain a child under\nINA 203(h)\nor that the application for adjustment of status will be approved as a matter of discretion dilutes the strength of the alien’s reliance on the past practice.\n[18]\nThus, while USCIS is always cognizant of any reliance interests no matter how small, USCIS believes that, for the reasons outlined in the policy guidance, the policy concerns addressed with this update outweigh the alien’s concerns that prompted the February 14, 2023 policy.\n[19]\nTo address reliance interests of those aliens who have already filed adjustment of status applications, USCIS determined that it will apply this policy change prospectively only to applications filed on or after August 15, 2025. USCIS continues to apply the February 14, 2023 policy to aliens whose adjustment of status application are pending with USCIS before August 15, 2025.\nMoreover, if an alien demonstrates extraordinary circumstances for not applying for adjustment of status during the period of the former policy between February 14, 2023 and August 14, 2025 where a visa was available for CSPA age calculations at the same time a visa was immediately available for an alien to apply for adjustment of status under the February 14, 2023 policy, USCIS calculates the alien’s age under that former policy.\nFootnotes\n[^ 1]\nSee\nRevising Age Calculation Under the Child Status Protection Act\n, PA-2025-15, issued August 8, 2025 (effective August 15, 2025).\n[^ 2]\nSee\nAge Calculation Under the Child Status Protection (PDF, 345 KB)\n,\nPA-2023-2, issued February 14, 2023.\n[^ 3]\nSee\n8 CFR 245.1(g)\n.\n[^ 4]\nSee\nChild Status Protection Act (PDF, 167.53 KB)\n, PA-2018-05, issued May 23, 2018.\n[^ 5]\nSee\nAge Calculation under Child Status Protection Act (PDF, 345 KB)\n, PA-2023-02, issued February 14, 2023.\n[^ 6]\nSee the DOS\nVisa Bulletin\nwebpage.\n[^ 7]\nSee\nAge Calculation under Child Status Protection Act (PDF, 345 KB)\n, PA-2023-02, issued February 14, 2023\n[^ 8]\nSee\nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n(PDF)\n,\n603 U.S. 369 (2024).\n[^ 9]\nAt least one court has addressed the meaning of when an immigrant visa “becomes available” under\nINA 203(h)\n. In\nLin Liu v. Smith,\n515 F. Supp. 3d 193, 197 (S.D.N.Y. 2021), the court determined that the ordinary meaning of the term “available” under\nINA 203(h)\nmeant that “a visa number cannot be considered available until it can be issued legally,” and thus, found that DOS was correct to tether availability for purposes of\nINA 203(h)\nto the Final Action Dates chart. The holding in this District court decision does not have precedential value and is not binding on USCIS, see, for example,\nMatter of Rosales Vargas\n, 27 I&N Dec. 745, 749 n.7 (BIA 2020); nevertheless, USCIS believes that the reasoning contained in this decision is persuasive in the context of “becomes available” under\nINA 203(h)\n.\n[^ 10]\nCongress embedded\nINA 203(h)\nwithin\nINA 203\n, which addresses the allocation of immigrant visas generally. In this section, Congress authorized DOS to administer the visa quota system consistent with numerical limitations imposed by Congress. See\nINA 203(e)-(g)\n. The statute authorizes DOS to make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued and to rely on those numbers when authorizing the issuance of immigrant visas. See\nINA 203(e)-(g)\n. See\n22 CFR 42.51\nand\n22 CFR 42.54\n. The availability of an immigrant visa under\nINA 203(h)\nis thus closely tied to DOS’ allocation of immigrant visa numbers for the issuance of immigrant visas, for which DOS uses the Final Action Dates chart. See\nINA 245(b)\n(upon approval of an adjustment of status application under\nINA 245(a)\n, DOS reduces the number of corresponding visas authorized for issuance under\nINA 202\nand\nINA 203\nby one within the class to which the alien is chargeable for the fiscal year then current).\n[^ 11]\nIn analyzing the statute’s plain language and structure, as well as Congress’ contemporaneous understanding of immigration law at the time of the CSPA’s enactment, courts have recognized that Congress only intended the CSPA to address children aging out because of delays in the adjudication of immigrant petitions, not because of delays due to statutory limits on visa allocations. For example, see\nScialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio\n, 573 U.S. 41, 53 (2014) (plurality op.) (“But the time in between—the months or, more likely, years the alien spends simply waiting for a visa to become available—is not similarly excluded in calculating his age: Every day the alien stands in that line is a day he grows older, under the immigration laws no less than in life. And so derivative beneficiaries, as well as principal beneficiaries of F2A petitions, can still ‘age out’ . . . prior to receiving an opportunity to immigrate.”). Using the Final Action Dates chart is more consistent with this purpose because it only mitigates the consequences of the administrative delays, but not any additional time spent waiting before DOS can authorize a visa number for issuance.\n[^ 12]\nSee\nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n(PDF)\n,\n603 U.S. 369, 394 (2024).\n[^ 13]\nFor example, see\nH.R. Rep. 107-45\n, p. 2, 2002 U.S.C.C.A.N. 640, 641(2001) (describing the mechanics of immigrant visa availability and the associated waiting list).\n[^ 14]\nAs it is the case with all USCIS Policy Manual guidance, this update to current USCIS policy guidance is based on USCIS’ interpretation of the applicable terms in the INA and the necessary policies and procedures to implement them. An agency is not required to use the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) notice-and-comment procedures to issue interpretive rules, general statements of policy or rules of agency organization and procedure or practice. See\n5 U.S.C. 553\n. Additionally, this policy guidance relates to the efforts of USCIS to control the status, exit, and entry of aliens, which constitutes a foreign affairs function under the APA.

USCIS is a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Our privacy policy explains how we handle the personally identifiable information (PII) that you provide to us when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. PII includes information that is personal in nature and which may be used to identify you. You may provide PII to us when you email us or send a request for information, when you fill out a questionnaire or satisfaction survey, when you participate in a research study, etc. We do not require you to register or provide PII to visit our website.

The section below explains how we handle and collect information when you visit\nwww.uscis.gov\n.\nThe PII you provide on a DHS website will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it. We will protect your information consistent with the principles of the\nPrivacy Act of 1974\n, the\nE-Government Act of 2002\n, and the\nFederal Records Act\n.\nPersonally Identifiable Information\nAs a general rule, DHS does not collect PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving DHS your permission to use the information for a specific, stated purpose. However, not providing certain information may prevent us from providing you with the service you desire.\nIf you choose to provide us with PII on a DHS website, through such methods as completing a web form, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or service you have requested. The information we may receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.\nWe only share the PII you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give your PII to any private organizations. We never collect information for commercial marketing.\nIf we store your PII in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.), so that we may contact you, we will safeguard the information you provide to us in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a).

      "content": "Visa Availability and Priority Dates\nThis page will help you understand how the U.S Department of State (DOS) allocates immigrant visas, the DOS Visa Bulletin process, and specific ways to adjust status depending on your situation.\nAvailability of Immigrant Visas\nThe\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA)\nsets the number of immigrant visas the U.S. Department of State (DOS) can issue to aliens seeking to become lawful permanent residents (get a Green Card) each year.\nImmigrant visas for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens are unlimited, so they are always available. Immediate relatives include:\nThe spouses of U.S. citizens;\nThe children (unmarried and under 21 years of age) of U.S. citizens;\nThe parents of U.S. citizens at least 21 years old; and\nWidows or widowers of U.S. citizens if the U.S. citizen filed a petition before they died, or if the widow(er) files a petition within two years of the citizen’s death.\nImmigrant visas for the family-sponsored and employment-based immigrant preference categories are numerically limited, so they are not always immediately available. For more information, please see the\nGreen Card Eligibility\npage.\nIn general, family-sponsored preference visas are limited to 226,000 visas per year, and employment-based preference visas are limited to 140,000 visas per year. (By statute, these annual visa limits may be exceeded when certain immigrant visas from the previous fiscal year’s allocation were not fully used.) Both categories are divided into several sub-categories, each of which receives a certain percentage of the overall visa numbers as prescribed by law. In addition, there are limits to the percentage of visas that can be allotted based on an immigrant’s country of chargeability (usually the country of birth).\nWhen the demand is higher than the supply of visas for a given year in any given category or country, a visa queue (a waiting list or backlog) forms. To distribute the visas among all preference categories, DOS allocates the visas according to a prospective immigrant’s preference category, country of chargeability, and\npriority date\n. DOS uses the priority date to determine an immigrant’s place in the visa queue. When the priority date becomes available, or is “current,” immigrants may be able to apply for adjustment of status (or apply for an immigrant visa with DOS if they are outside the U.S.) and obtain lawful permanent resident status, if otherwise eligible.\nAcceptance of Adjustment of Status Applications\nWe will accept\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n, from family-sponsored and employment-based adjustment of status preference applicants according to the monthly Visa Bulletin that DOS publishes as a guide for issuing visas at U.S. Consulates and Embassies.\nThe monthly\nDOS Visa Bulletin\nsummarizes the availability of immigrant visas according to the:\nApplication Final Action Dates chart (consistent with previous Visa Bulletins) and\nDates for Filing Applications chart indicating when immigrant visa applicants should be notified to assemble and submit required documentation to the National Visa Center.\nWhen we determine there are more immigrant visas available for the fiscal year than there are known applicants, you may use the Dates for Filing Applications chart to determine when to file an adjustment of status application with USCIS. Otherwise, you must use the Application Final Action Dates chart to determine when to file an adjustment of status application with USCIS.\nUnless otherwise indicated on our\nAdjustment of Status Filing Charts for Visa Bulletin\nwebpage, you must use the “Application Final Action Dates” for determining when you can file a Form I-485 with USCIS.\nDOS, working with the Department of Homeland Security, revises the Visa Bulletin each month to estimate immigrant visa availability for prospective adjustment of status applicants. If DOS makes any changes to either chart in the Visa Bulletin after publishing it, we will review those changes and determine if any further action is necessary. Check the latest\ndates for filing adjustment of status applications\n.\nFinding Your Priority Date\nIf you are a prospective immigrant, you can find your priority date on\nForm I-797, Notice of Action\n, for the petition filed on your behalf. The waiting time before receiving an immigrant visa or adjusting status depends on the :\nDemand for and supply of immigrant visas.\nPer-country visa limitations; and\nNumber of visas allocated for your preference category.\nPriority Dates for Family-Sponsored Preference Cases\nFor family-sponsored immigrants, the priority date is the date that the\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n, or in certain instances the\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\n, is properly filed with USCIS.\nPriority Dates for Employment-Based Preference Cases\nFor employment-based immigrants, the priority date depends on the following:\nIf\nThen your priority date is the date:\nYour preference category requires a labor certification from Department of Labor (DOL)\nDOL accepts the labor certification application for processing.\nTo preserve the priority date, the petitioner must file\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\n, with USCIS within 180 days of the DOL approval date on the labor certification or else the labor certification is no longer valid.\nYour preference category does not require a DOL labor certification\nUSCIS accepts Form I-140 for processing to classify the sponsored worker under the requested preference category.\nYou are a fourth preference special immigrant, including religious workers\nUSCIS accepts\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er) or Special Immigrant\n, for processing.\nYou are a fifth preference investor\nUSCIS accepts\nForm I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur\n, for processing.\nChecking Your Place in the Visa Queue\nThe Visa Bulletin allows you to check your place in the immigrant visa queue. The Visa Bulletin provides the most recent date for when a visa number is available for the different categories and countries for family-sponsored, employment-based, and diversity (lottery) visas.\nA visa must be available before you can take one of the final steps in the process of becoming a lawful permanent resident. Because more prospective immigrants want lawful permanent residency than the limited numbers of immigrant visas allow, not everyone can immediately get an immigrant visa. How long you must wait depends on your priority date, preference category, and the country to which the visa will be charged.\nIf the demand for immigrant visas is more than the supply for a particular category and country of chargeability, DOS considers the category and country “oversubscribed” and must impose a cut-off date to keep the allocation of visas within the statutory limits.\nA visa is available to you when your priority date is earlier than the cut-off date shown for your preference category and country of chargeability in the applicable chart in the Visa Bulletin, as described above in the Acceptance of Adjustment of Status Applications section.\nFor example, if the Visa Bulletin shows a date of 15DEC07 for China in the family preference category (F1), visas are currently available for immigrants who have a priority date earlier than Dec. 15, 2007. Sometimes the demand for immigrant visas is less than the supply in a particular category and country of chargeability. In this situation, the Visa Bulletin shows that category as “C,” meaning that immigrant visas are currently (immediately) available to all qualified adjustment of status applicants and overseas immigrant visa applicants in that particular preference category and country of chargeability.\nIf the Visa Bulletin shows “U” in a category, this means that immigrant visas are temporarily unavailable to all applicants in that particular preference category and/or country of chargeability.\nVisa Retrogression\nSometimes, a priority date that is current one month will not be current the next month, or the cut-off date will move backward to an earlier date. This is called\nvisa retrogression\n, which occurs when more people apply for a visa in a particular category than there are visas available for that month. Visa retrogression generally occurs when the annual limit for a category or country has been exhausted or is expected to run out soon. When the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, a new supply of visa numbers becomes available. Usually, but not always, the new supply returns the cut-off dates to where they were before retrogression.\nConcurrent Filing\nIn certain instances, you can file your Form I-485 together, or “concurrently,” with the underlying Form I-130 or Form I-140 immigrant petition. You may\nconcurrently file your Form I-485\nonly when approval of the underlying immigrant petition would make a visa immediately available to you. If you are an immediate relative, you can always concurrently file your Form I-485 application with the underlying Form I-130.\nIf you are seeking adjustment of status under a family-sponsored or employment-based preference category, you may concurrently file your Form I-485 with Form I-130 or Form I-140 only if:\nYour priority date is earlier than the cut-off date listed in the “Application Final Action Dates” chart in the monthly Visa Bulletin for your preference category and country of chargeability;\nThe Visa Bulletin chart indicates “C” instead of a specific cut-off date, meaning that your preference category and country of chargeability is current and that you may file Form I-485 regardless of the priority date; or\nWhen permitted by USCIS (as described above in “Acceptance of Adjustment Status Applications”), your priority date is earlier than the cut-off date listed in the “Dates for Filing Applications” chart for your preference category and country of chargeability.\nRelated Links\nWhen to File Your Adjustment of Status Application for Family-Based or Employment-Based Preference Visas\nVisa Retrogression\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n01/24/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Child Status Protection Act (CSPA)\nAlert Type info\nAlert:\nUSCIS issued policy guidance in the\nUSCIS Policy Manual\nto update when an immigrant visa “becomes available” for the purpose of calculating Child Status Protection Act age. This guidance is effective on August 15, 2025, and applies to adjustment of status applications filed on or after August 15, 2025.\nFor more information, see\nVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 7 of the USCIS Policy Manual\n.\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines a child as a person who is both unmarried and under 21 years old. If an alien applies for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status as a child but turns 21 before being approved for LPR status (also known as getting a Green Card), that alien can no longer be considered a child for immigration purposes. This situation is commonly referred to as aging out, and may mean these aliens must file a new petition or application or wait even longer to get a Green Card, or are no longer eligible for a Green Card.\nCongress recognized that many children were aging out due to large USCIS processing backlogs, so it enacted the Child Status Protection Act to protect certain aliens from aging out. The CSPA went into effect on Aug. 6, 2002.\nCSPA does not change the definition of a child. Instead, it provides a method for calculating an alien’s  age to see if they meet the definition of a child for immigration purposes. The calculated age is the child’s “CSPA age.” This allows some aliens to remain classified as children beyond their 21\nst\nbirthday. However, CSPA does not change the requirement that an alien must be unmarried to remain eligible for classification as a child.\nCSPA Applicability and Eligibility\nCSPA applies only to the following aliens applying for adjustment of status:\nImmediate relatives (including derivatives of widow(er)s);\nFamily-sponsored preference principal applicants and derivative applicants;\nViolence Against Women Act (VAWA) self-petitioners and derivative applicants;\nEmployment-based preference derivative applicants;\nDiversity Immigrant Visa derivative applicants;\nDerivative refugees; and\nDerivative asylees.\nIf you are applying for a Green Card based on one of the categories above, you are eligible for CSPA consideration if either your qualifying\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n, or one of the following underlying forms was filed or pending on or after Aug. 6, 2002:\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n;\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\n;\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\n;\nForm I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur;\nForm I-526E, Immigrant Petition by Regional Center Investor\n;\nForm I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal\n;\nForm I-590, Registration for Classification as a Refugee; or\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition\n.\nCSPA for Refugees and Asylees\nIf you are a derivative refugee, your CSPA age is your age on the date your principal refugee parent or Form I-730 petitioner filed their Form I-590, which is the date of their interview with a USCIS officer. If you were under age 21 at the time of your parent’s interview, your age is frozen as of that date, and you will not age out. While you must be unmarried to qualify for admission into the U.S. as a derivative refugee, you do not need to remain unmarried to qualify for a Green Card under INA section 209.\nIf you are a derivative asylee, your CSPA age is your age on the date your principal asylee parent or Form I-730 petitioner filed their\nForm I-589\n. If you were under age 21 when your parent filed Form I-589, your age is frozen as of that date, and you will not age out. Unlike derivative refugees, you must be unmarried to qualify for a grant of derivative asylum and to qualify for a Green Card under INA section 209.\nCSPA for Immediate Relatives\nIf you are an immediate relative, a VAWA self-petitioning abused spouse or child of a U.S. citizen, or a derivative child of a VAWA self-petitioning abused spouse or child of a U.S. citizen, your age is frozen on the date the\nForm I-130\nor\nForm I-360\nis filed. If you were under age 21 at the time the petition was filed, you are eligible for CSPA and will not age out. However, you must remain unmarried to qualify.\nIf the petitioner of a pending or approved immediate relative spousal petition dies, their spouse’s Form I-130 automatically converts to a widow(er)’s Form I-360. The widow(er)’s children, if any, who are under the age of 21 and unmarried at the time of the petitioner’s death can be classified as derivatives on the automatically converted Form I-360 and so qualify for the CSPA.\nCSPA for Family and Employment Preference and Diversity Visa Immigrants\nIf you are an alien applying for family preference (including VAWA self-petition), employment-based preference, or a diversity visa (DV) , calculate your CSPA age by subtracting the number of days your petition was pending (pending time) from your age on the date an immigrant visa becomes available to you (age at time of visa availability). However, you must remain unmarried to qualify.\nThe formula for calculating CSPA is:\nAge at Time of Visa Availability - Pending Time = CSPA Age\nExample:\nYou are 21 years and 4 months old when USCIS considers an immigrant visa available to you. Your petition was pending for 6 months. Calculate your CSPA age as follows:\n21 years and 4 months - 6 months = 20 years and 10 months\nAge at Time of Visa Availability\nThe date the visa is considered available is the later of these 2 dates:\nThe date the petition was approved; or\nThe first day of the month of the\nDepartment of State Visa Bulletin\nthat indicates that a visa is available for you in the Final Action Dates chart.\nFor DVs, the date a visa is considered available for CSPA purposes is the first day when the Department of State can allocate a visa number based on the principal alien’s rank number.\nPending Time\nThe length of time a petition was pending (pending time) is the number of days between the date that it is properly filed (filing date) and the approval date. Use this formula to determine the pending time:\nApproval Date - Filing Date = Pending Time\nExample:\nYour mother filed a petition for you on Feb. 1, 2016. We approved the petition on Aug. 1, 2016.\nAug. 1, 2016 - Feb. 1, 2016 = 6 months\nFor DV derivatives, the number of days the petition was pending is the time between the start of the DV Program registration period and the date of the DV selection letter.\nExample:\nThe DV Program registration period began on Oct. 1, 2012, and the DV selection Letter is dated May 1, 2013.\nMay 1, 2013 - Oct. 1, 2012 = 7 months\nNote:\nIf an alien has multiple approved petitions, calculate the alien’s CSPA age using the petition that forms the underlying basis for the adjustment of status application. If we approve a request to transfer the underlying basis of the pending adjustment of status application, calculate your CSPA age using your age at the time your immigrant visa becomes available, minus the pending time for the petition that forms the new basis of your adjustment of status application.\nFor more information on CSPA age calculation, see\nVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 7, Part F, Section 2 of the USCIS Policy Manual\n.\nSought to Acquire Requirement\nTo benefit from CSPA as an alien applying for family preference (including VAWA self-petition), employment-based preference, or a DV , you must seek to acquire lawful permanent resident status within 1 year of when a visa becomes available . This is referred to as the “sought to acquire” requirement.\nYou may satisfy this requirement by:\nProperly filing\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n;\nSubmitting a completed Part 1 of\nForm DS-260, Immigrant Visa Electronic Application\n;\nPaying the immigrant visa fee to the Department of State;\nPaying the\nForm I-864, Affidavit of Support\n, review fee to the Department of State (provided the alien is listed on the Affidavit of Support); or\nHaving a\nForm I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition\n, properly filed on your behalf.\nA written request to transfer the underlying basis of the adjustment of status application also will meet the “sought to acquire” requirement, if we receive the request within 1 year of an immigrant visa becoming available in the new preference category.\nIf you have a pending adjustment application as a derivative child, and we grant the principal alien’s request to transfer the underlying basis of their adjustment application to a different immigrant category based on another approved petition, then the date we receive the transfer request is the date we use to determine whether you meet the sought to acquire requirement.\nIf you do not meet the sought to acquire requirement, we may use our discretion to determine that you satisfy  this requirement if you  establish that your failure to meet this requirement was the result of extraordinary circumstances. For more information on extraordinary circumstances for the sought to acquire requirement, see\nVolume 7, Part A, Chapter 7, Section H\n.\nNaturalization of the Petitioner in Family Preference Cases\nWhen a lawful permanent resident (LPR) files a\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\nfor their child or unmarried son or daughter, the petition is classified as a family second preference case. If the petitioner naturalizes (becomes a U.S. citizen) before their child or unmarried son or daughter gets a Green Card, the petition is converted to either an immediate relative or family first preference case.\nChild of LPR (F2A) Becomes Child of a U.S. Citizen (Immediate Relative)\nIf your LPR parent filed a Form I-130 for you as their child and then your parent became a U.S. citizen before you turn 21, your age “freezes” on the date your parent became a U.S citizen. You become an immediate relative and will not age out.\nUnmarried Son or Daughter of LPR (F2B) Becomes Unmarried Son or Daughter of U.S. Citizen (F1)\nIf your LPR parent filed a Form I-130 for you as an unmarried son or daughter (second preference classification) and then your parent became a U.S. citizen, you normally would automatically convert to a first preference classification as the unmarried son or daughter of a U.S. citizen (F1). However, you may choose to opt out of the automatic conversion and stay in second preference classification (F2B) if the waiting time for the second preference visa is shorter than the waiting time for the first preference visa. You may check the\nVisa Bulletin\nto see if opting out of automatic conversion may result in a shorter waiting time for you.\nIf you want to opt out of the automatic conversion, you must submit a written request to the USCIS office that approved your Form I-130. You (not your parent) should send a signed letter stating that you wish to opt out of the conversion from F2B to F1. This letter should also include your and your parent’s names and dates of birth and the receipt number for your Form I-130. You can find the receipt number on the receipt and approval notices. The approval notice will also show you which office approved your Form I-130.\nIf you do not know which USCIS office approved your Form I-130, you may call our\nUSCIS Contact Center\n.\nCSPA for K-2 and K-4 Nonimmigrants\nWhile K nonimmigrants are not covered under CSPA, K-2 and K-4 nonimmigrants may benefit from CSPA under certain limited circumstances.\nLimited CSPA Coverage for K-2 Nonimmigrants\nAs a K-2 nonimmigrant (child of a K-1 nonimmigrant who is the fiancé(e) of a U.S. citizen), you typically get a Green Card based on your admission into the U.S. with a K-2 visa if your K-1 parent married the U.S. citizen petitioner within 90 days of being admitted to the U.S. If you were under 21 when you were admitted to the United States as a K-2 nonimmigrant, you will not age out of eligibility for a Green Card. In these circumstances, you are not eligible for CSPA and do not need it to get a Green Card.\nYou are only eligible for CSPA if you are the beneficiary of a\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n. In most cases, you do not need a Form I-130 to get a Green Card if you are a K-2 nonimmigrant. However, if your K-1 nonimmigrant parent did not marry your U.S. citizen stepparent within 90 days of being admitted to the U.S. (a requirement for getting a Green Card based on K-1 and K-2 nonimmigrant status), your stepparent might choose to file Form I-130 for you as a stepchild.\nTo qualify as a stepchild, the marriage between your U.S. citizen stepparent and your K‑1 nonimmigrant parent must have occurred before your 18th birthday. Since your age “freezes” on the date your stepparent files the Form I-130, you may benefit from the CSPA to remain an immediate relative as long as your stepparent files the Form I-130 before your 21st birthday.\nFor more information about K-1 and K-2 nonimmigrant visas, see the\nFiancé(e) Visas\npage. For more information about applying for a Green Card as a K-1 or K-2 nonimmigrant, see the\nGreen Card for Fiancé(e) of U.S. Citizen page\n.\nLimited CSPA Coverage for K-4 Nonimmigrants\nIf you are a K-4 nonimmigrant, you are eligible for CSPA because you will apply for a Green Card as an immediate relative based on a Form I-130 filed by your U.S. citizen stepparent.\nTo qualify as a stepchild, the marriage between your U.S. citizen stepparent and your K‑3 nonimmigrant parent must have occurred before your 18th birthday. Since your age “freezes” on the date the Form I-130 is filed, you benefit from the CSPA to remain an immediate relative as long as your stepparent files the Form I-130 before your 21st birthday.\nFor more information on K-4 visas, see the\nK-3/K-4 Nonimmigrant Visas page\n.\nLegal Reference\nFor more information about CSPA, see the following:\nFor refugees, see\nINA 207(c)(2)(B)\nFor asylees, see\nINA 208(b)(3)(B)\nFor refugee and asylee adjustment of status (Green Card), see\nINA 209\nFor immediate relatives, see\nINA 201(f)\nFor family and employment preference and Diversity Visa immigrants, see\nINA 203(h)\nFor general CSPA information, see\nUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part A, Adjustment of Status Policies and Procedures, Chapter 7, Child Status Protection Act\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n08/15/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

Therefore, concurrent filing is only available for an applicant who is physically present in the United States and requesting to adjust to lawful permanent resident status (becomes a Green Card holder).\nVisa Availability and Concurrent Filing\nYou may file your petition and application concurrently when there is a visa number immediately available at the time of filing. Concurrent filing is always allowed for all immediate relatives of a United States citizen because there are no numeric limitations in this category. However, in some categories, even if there is a visa number available at the time of filing, you may not be allowed to file concurrently unless you have an approved basis of eligibility (that is, an approved petition) before being allowed to file for adjustment of status. For more information on whether you can file concurrently, refer to the instructions on your immigrant petition:\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\nWhen adjudicating concurrent filings, we determine the eligibility for the immigrant visa petition first. If a visa number remains available for the immigrant classification and your Form I-485 is approvable (which, in certain cases, requires an interview), we will generally consider the adjustment application at the same time. We will mail separate decision notices for both forms.\nFor more information, see our\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\npage.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n06/20/2024\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

Go to our\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\npage to see all the possible categories you can apply under and what the eligibility requirements are.\nBeing Sponsored for a Green Card\nMost people who apply for a Green Card will need to complete at least two forms—an immigrant petition and a Green Card application (Form I-485).

      "content": "Consular Processing\nOnce you are the beneficiary of an approved immigrant petition and an immigrant visa number is immediately available to you, there are two ways to apply for lawful permanent resident status (a Green Card). If you are outside of the United States, you may apply at a U.S. Department of State consulate abroad for an immigrant visa in order to come to the United States and be admitted as a permanent resident. This pathway is referred to as consular processing.\nIf you are already in the United States, you can apply for permanent resident status without having to return to your home country to complete processing. This process is called adjustment of status. For more information, see our\nAdjustment of Status\npage.\nSteps for Consular Processing\n1. Determine Your Basis to Immigrate\nThe first step in consular processing is to determine if you are eligible to\napply for a Green Card\n(lawful permanent residence). Most immigrants become eligible through a petition filed on your behalf by a family member or employer. Others become permanent residents by first obtaining refugee or asylum status, or through a number of other special provisions. To see the many different ways to get a Green Card, go to our\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\npage.\n2. File the Immigrant Petition\nWhen you know what category you believe best fits your situation, you usually will need someone else to file an immigrant petition for you.\nFamily-based immigrant petition\n: If you want to apply for a Green Card based on your family relationship, a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative must file a\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\nfor you. For more information, see our\nFamily\npage.\nEmployment-based immigrant petition\n: If you want to apply for a Green Card based on your employment, your U.S. employer must file a\nForm I-140, Petition for Alien Worker\nfor you. If you intend to invest significant amounts of capital into a business venture in the United States, you may file\nForm I-526, Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur\nfor yourself. For more information, see our\nWorking in the U.S.\npage.\nSpecial categories\n: In some cases, you may file a\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), and Special Immigrant\nfor yourself or have someone else file one for you.\nHumanitarian programs\n: Most humanitarian programs do not require you to have an immigrant petition, although you may need to meet additional requirements before they can apply for a Green Card. For more information, see our\nHumanitarian\npage.\nPlease check with the consulate before submitting a petition. For more information, see the\nU.S. Department of State\nwebsite.\n3. Wait for a Decision on Your Petition\nUSCIS notifies the petitioner of a decision. If USCIS denies the petition, the notice will include the reasons for denying the petition and whether you may appeal the decision. If the petition is approved and you live outside the United States (or live in the United States but want to apply for your immigrant visa abroad), USCIS will then send the approved petition to the Department of State’s National Visa Center. The petition will remain there until an immigrant visa number is available for you. See our\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\npages for more information.\n4. Wait for Notification from the National Visa Center\nThe National Visa Center (NVC) is responsible for\ncollecting visa application fees and supporting documentation\n. The NVC will notify the petitioner and you (the beneficiary) when the visa petition is received and again when an immigrant visa number is about to become available. They will also notify you when you must submit immigrant visa processing fees (commonly referred to as “fee bills”) and supporting documentation.\n5. Go to Your Appointment\nOnce a visa is available or your priority date is current (earlier than the cut-off date listed in the monthly\nVisa Bulletin\n), the consular office will schedule you for an interview. The consular office will process your case and decide if you are eligible for an immigrant visa.\n6. Notify the National Visa Center of Any Changes\nYou do not need to contact the National Visa Center about your petition; they will contact you for the information they need. You should, however, contact the NVC if:\nYou change your address,\nYou were under 21 but have now reached the age of 21, or\nYou change your marital status.\nThese changes may affect your eligibility or visa availability. Go to the Department of State’s\nNational Visa Center Contact Information\npage for information on how to contact the NVC.\n7. After Your Visa is Granted\nIf you are granted an immigrant visa, the consular officer will give you a packet of information. This packet is known as a “Visa Packet.” Do not open this packet.\nYou will need to pay a\nUSCIS Immigrant Fee\n. USCIS uses this fee to process your immigrant visa packet and produce your Green Card. We encourage you to\npay the fee online\nafter you receive your visa packet and before you depart for the United States.\nWhen you arrive in the United States, you should give your Visa Packet to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at the port of entry. The CBP officer will inspect you and determine whether to admit you into the United States as a lawful permanent resident. If the CBP officer admits you, you will then have lawful permanent resident status and be able to live and work in the United States permanently.\n8. Receive Your Green Card\nIf you have paid the\nUSCIS Immigrant Fee\n, you will receive your Green Card in the mail after you arrive in the United States. If you do not receive your Green Card within 90 days of your arrival, please call our\nUSCIS Contact Center\nat 800-375-5283 or visit the e-Request-\nNon-Delivery of Card page\nto create an inquiry.\nIf you did not pay the USCIS Immigrant Fee before you arrived in the United States, you will need to pay the fee before USCIS will send you a Green Card.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n07/20/2023\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Affidavit of Support\nForm I-864, Affidavit of Support under Section 213A of the INA\n, is a contract an individual signs agreeing to use their financial resources to support the intending immigrant named on the affidavit. The individual who signs the affidavit of support becomes the sponsor once the intending immigrant becomes a lawful permanent resident. The sponsor is usually the petitioner who filed an immigrant petition on behalf of the intending immigrant.\nAn affidavit of support is a legally enforceable contract, and the sponsor’s responsibility usually lasts until the family member or other individual either becomes a U.S. citizen, or is credited with 40 quarters of work (usually 10 years).\nThe law concerning the affidavit of support is found in Sections 212(a)(4) and 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The provisions are codified in Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 8 CFR 213a.\nSubmitting an Affidavit of Support\nThe following individuals are required by law to submit a\nForm I-864, Affidavit of Support\ncompleted by the petitioner to obtain an immigrant visa or adjustment of status:\nAll immediate relatives of U.S. citizens (which include parents, spouses, and unmarried children under the age of 21, including orphans) and relatives who qualify for immigration to the United States under one of the family based preferences:\nFirst Preference: Unmarried, adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (Adult means 21 years of age or older)\nSecond Preference: Spouses of permanent residents and the unmarried sons and daughters (regardless of age) of permanent residents and their unmarried children\nThird Preference: Married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, their spouses and their unmarried minor children\nFourth Preference: Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens, their spouses and their unmarried minor children\nEmployment based preference immigrants in cases only when a U.S. citizen or permanent resident relative filed the immigrant visa petition, or such relative has a significant ownership interest (5% or more) in the entity that filed the petition.\nNote\n: An individual listed above does not need to submit an affidavit of support if they can show that they EITHER:\nAlready worked 40 qualifying quarters as defined in Title II of the Social Security Act\nCan be credited with 40 qualifying quarters as defined in Title II of the Social Security Act\nAre the child of a U.S. citizen and if admitted for permanent residence on or after February 27, 2001, would automatically acquire citizenship under Section 320 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended by the Child Citizenship Act of 2000\nResponsibilities as a Sponsor\nWhen you sign the affidavit of support, you accept legal responsibility for financially supporting the sponsored immigrant(s), generally until they become U.S. citizens or are credited with 40 quarters of work. Your obligation as a sponsor also ends if you or the individual sponsored dies or if the individual sponsored ceases to be a lawful permanent resident and departs the United States.\nNote:\nDivorce does NOT end the sponsorship obligation.\nIf an immigrant you sponsored receives any means-tested public benefits, you are responsible for repaying the cost of those benefits to the agency that provided them. If you do not repay the debt, the agency or the immigrant can sue you in court to get the money owed. Any joint sponsors and household members who  allowed the sponsor to combine their income with the sponsor’s income to meet the minimum income requirements are also legally responsible for financially supporting the sponsored immigrant. In fact, any joint sponsor and household member is jointly or severally liable with the petitioning sponsor, meaning that the joint sponsor and household member are independently liable for the full extent of the reimbursement obligation and can be sued in court or be asked to pay the money owed, even if the petitioning sponsor is not sued or asked for money.\nPenalties for Falsifying an Affidavit\nIf you knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal a material fact or submit a false document with your Form I-864, we will deny your Form I-864 and may deny any other immigration benefit. In addition, you will face severe penalties provided by law and may be subject to criminal prosecution. The U.S. government may pursue verification of any information provided on or in support of this affidavit, including employment, income, or assets with the employer, financial or other institutions, the IRS, or the\nSocial Security Administration\n.\nIf you include in this affidavit of support any information that you know to be false, you may be liable for criminal prosecution under the laws of the United States.\nIf you fail to provide notice of your change of address, as required by 8 U.S.C. 1183a(d) and 8 CFR 213a.3, you may be liable for the civil penalty established by 8 U.S.C. 1183a(d)(2). The amount of the civil penalty will depend on whether you failed to provide this notice because you were aware that the immigrants you sponsored had received Federal, state, or local means-tested public benefits. If the failure to report your change of address occurs with knowledge that the sponsored immigrant received means-tested public benefits (other than benefits described in section 401(b), 403(c)(2), or 4ll(b) of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which are summarized in Part 8. Sponsor’s Contract, Statement, Contact Information, Declaration, Certification, and Signature of Form I-864) such failure may result in a fine of not less than $2,000 or more than $5,000. Otherwise, the failure to report your change of address may result in a fine not less than $250 or more than $2,000.\nWhen NOT to Submit an Affidavit of Support\nThe following types of people do not need to file an affidavit of support:\nAn individual who has earned or can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters (credits) of work in the United States\nAn individual who has an approved\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\nas a self-petitioning widow or widower\nAn individual who has an approved Form I-360 as a battered spouse or child\nOrphans adopted by U.S. citizens abroad if a full and formal adoption takes place before the orphan acquires permanent residence and both adoptive parents have seen the child before or during the adoption\nAffidavit of Support For Fiancé(e), Spouse, or Child as a “K” Nonimmigrant\nIf your relative is either a K-1 fiancé(e), a K-3 spouse, or a K-2 or K-4 child of fiancé(e) or spouse, you do not need to submit an affidavit of support at the time you file your Form I-129F petition. Instead, you should submit an affidavit of support at the time that your fiancé(e), spouse, or child adjusts status to permanent resident after coming to the United States.\nSponsor for Affidavit of Support\nIf you filed an immigrant visa petition for your relative, you must be the sponsor. You must also be at least 18 years old and a U.S. citizen or a permanent resident. You must have a domicile in the United States or a territory or possession of the United States. Usually, this requirement means you must actually live in the United States, or a territory or possession, in order to be a sponsor. If you live abroad, you may still be eligible to be a sponsor if you can show that your residence abroad is temporary, and that you still have your domicile in the United States.\nSection 213A of the INA permits both a \"joint sponsor\" and a \"substitute sponsor\" in certain cases.\nJoint Sponsor\nA joint sponsor is someone who is willing to accept legal responsibility for supporting your family member with you. A joint sponsor must meet all the same requirements as you, except the joint sponsor does not need to be related to the immigrant. The joint sponsor (or the joint sponsor and his or her household) must reach the 125% income requirement alone. You cannot combine your income with that of a joint sponsor to meet the income requirement.\nSubstitute Sponsor\nIf the visa petitioner has died after approval of the visa petition but U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) decides to let the petition continue, a substitute sponsor must file a Form I-864 in place of the deceased visa petitioner. In order to be a “substitute sponsor,” you must be related to the intending immigrant in one of the following ways:\nSpouse\nParent\nMother-in-law\nFather-in-law\nSibling\nChild (if at least 18 years of age)\nSon\nDaughter\nSon-in-law\nDaughter-in-law\nSister-in-law\nBrother-in-law\nGrandparent\nGrandchild\nLegal guardian of the beneficiary\nYou must also:\nBe U.S. citizen or national or a permanent resident\nBe at least 18 years of age\nBe domiciled (live) in the United States\nMeet all of the financial requirements of a sponsor pursuant to INA 213A\nThe substitute sponsor assumes all of the obligations of an I-864 sponsor.\nHow to File an Affidavit of Support\nYou, the sponsor, should complete Form I-864 when your relative has been scheduled for an immigrant visa interview with a consular officer overseas or when your relative is about to submit an application for adjustment to permanent resident status with USCIS or with an Immigration Court in the United States. If you have a joint sponsor, they must also complete Form I-864. If you are using the income of other household members to qualify, then each household member who is accepting legal responsibility for supporting your relative must complete a separate\nForm I-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member\n.\nYou are required to provide your U.S. federal income tax return for the most recent tax year as well as proof of current employment. If you were not required to file a tax return in any of these years you must provide an explanation. Failure to provide the tax return or evidence establishing that you were not required to file will delay action on your relative's application for permanent residence. If this information is not provided, this will result in denial of an immigrant visa or adjustment of status.\nWhen you have completed the affidavit of support and compiled the necessary documentation in accordance with the requirements of section 213A of the Act and the form instructions, you should provide this packet of information to your relative to submit with his or her application for permanent resident status. If you are given specific instructions to file your affidavit of support directly with the National Visa Center, you should follow those instructions.\nIncome Requirements\nYou also must meet certain income requirements (whether you are a sponsor, a joint sponsor, or a substitute sponsor). You must show that your household income is equal to or higher than 125% of the U.S. poverty level for your household size. (Your household size includes you, your dependents, any relatives living with you, and the immigrants you are sponsoring.)\nIf you, the sponsor, are on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States, and the immigrant you are sponsoring is your spouse or child, your income only needs to equal 100% of the U.S. poverty level for your household size.\nTo see if you are above the poverty level, see\nForm I-864P, HHS Poverty Guidelines for Affidavit of Support\n.\nIf You Can’t Meet the Minimum Income Requirements\nIf you cannot meet the minimum income requirements using your earned income, you have various options:\nYou may add the cash value of your assets. This includes money in savings accounts, stocks, bonds, and property. To determine the amount of assets required to qualify, subtract your household income from the minimum income requirement (125% of the poverty level for your family size). You must prove the cash value of your assets is worth five times this difference (the amount left over).\nExceptions:\nIf the person being sponsored is a spouse, or son/daughter (who is 18 years or older) of a U.S. citizen: The minimum cash value of assets must be three times the difference between the sponsor’s household income and 125% of the federal poverty guide line for the household.\nIf the person being sponsored is an orphan coming to the United States for adoption: The adoptive parents’ assets need to equal or exceed the difference between the household income and 125% of the federal poverty line for the household size.\nYou may count the income and assets of members of your household who are related to you by birth, marriage, or adoption\n. To use their income you must have listed them as dependents on your most recent federal tax return or they must have lived with you for the last 6 months. They must also complete a\nForm I-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member\n. If the relative you are sponsoring meets these criteria you may include the value of their income and assets, but the immigrant does not need to complete Form I-864A unless he or she has accompanying family members.\nYou may count the assets of the relatives you are sponsoring.\nIncome Deeming and Reimbursement\nIncome Deeming\nSponsored immigrants may be ineligible for certain federal, state or local means-tested public benefits, because an agency will consider the resources and assets of the sponsor (and the sponsor’s household member, if applicable) when determining the immigrant’s eligibility for the means-tested public benefits program. This process is called “income deeming.”\nFor more information on income deeming, please see guidance issued for the following programs:\nMedicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program  (PDF)\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\nSupplemental Security Income\nReimbursement Actions\nIf the sponsored immigrant receives federal, state or local means-tested public benefits, the agency providing the benefit may ask the sponsor (and household member, if applicable) to repay the cost of those benefits.\nIf the sponsor (or household member) does not repay the cost, the agency can sue the sponsor (and household member) and obtain a court order for repayment. The Presidential Memorandum instructs such benefit granting agencies to seek reimbursement to the extent allowable under law.\nFor more information on reimbursement actions, please see guidance issued for the following programs:\nMedicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program  (PDF)\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\nSupplemental Security Income\nChange of Address\nIf you change your address after you become a sponsor, you are required by law to notify USCIS within 30 days by filing\nForm I-865, Sponsor's Notice of Change of Address\n. If you fail to notify USCIS of your change of address, you may be fined.\nForms\nI-864, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the Act\nI-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member\nI-864EZ, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the Act\nI-864P, Poverty Guidelines\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n09/04/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Green Card for Employment-Based Immigrants\nU.S. immigration law provides aliens with a variety of ways to become lawful permanent residents (get a Green Card) through employment in the United States. These employment-based (EB) “preference immigrant” categories include:\nFirst preference (EB-1)\n– priority workers\nAliens with extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics;\nOutstanding professors and researchers; or\nCertain multinational managers and executives.\nSecond preference (EB-2)\n– aliens who are members of the professions holding advanced degrees or who have exceptional ability (including requests for national interest waivers).\nThird preference (EB-3)\n– skilled workers, professionals, or other workers.\nThis page provides specific information for aliens in the United States who want to apply for lawful permanent resident status in the EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 categories while in the United States. This is called “adjustment of status.” You should also read the\nInstructions for Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\nbefore you apply.\nFor more information on other types of employment-based immigrants, see our pages on Green Cards for\nEB-4 special immigrants\n(for example, religious workers and special immigrant juveniles) and\nEB-5 immigrant investors\n.\nIf you are currently outside the United States\n, see\nConsular Processing\nfor information about how to apply for a Green Card as a family preference immigrant.\nEligibility for Adjustment of Status\nIf you are currently in the United States,\nin order to be eligible for a Green Card as an EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 immigrant, you must meet the following requirements:\nYou properly file\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n;\nYou were inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled into the United States;\nYou are physically present in the United States at the time you file your Form I-485;\nYou are eligible to receive an immigrant visa;\nAn immigrant visa is immediately available to you at the time you file your Form I-485 and at the time USCIS makes a final decision on your application. (For information on visa availability, see\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\n,\nAdjustment of Status Filing Charts\n, and the Department of State website to view the\nVisa Bulletin\n);\nThe job offered to you in the\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\nstill exists with the employer that filed the Form I-140 on your behalf, and you plan to accept the job once USCIS approves your Form I-485. If you filed Form I-140 as a self-petitioner, you must plan to work in the same or similar occupational field as specified in your Form I-140;\nNote: Even if you have a new job or employer,\nsection 204(j) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\nallows the approved Form I-140 to remain valid for adjustment of status purposes if:\nYou submit evidence that the new job is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job in the original Form I-140; and\nThe Form I-485 you filed based on the Form I-140 remains unadjudicated for 180 days or more; and\nNone of the applicable bars to adjustment of status apply to you;\nYou are admissible to the United States for lawful permanent residence or eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief; and\nYou merit the favorable exercise of\nUSCIS’ discretion\n.\nInspected and Admitted or Inspected and Paroled\nGenerally, to be eligible to adjust status, you must be present in the United States after being “inspected and admitted” or “inspected and paroled” by an immigration officer. There are some limited exceptions to this eligibility requirement. For more information on this requirement, see USCIS Policy Manual\nVolume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part B, Chapter 2, Section A, “Inspected and Admitted” or “Inspected and Paroled”\n.\nEligibility to Receive an Immigrant Visa\nYou are eligible to receive an immigrant visa, if you are the beneficiary of:\nAn approved Form I-140 filed on your behalf;\nA pending Form I-140 (that is ultimately approved); or\nA Form I-485 filed together with the Form I-140 (and the Form I-140 is ultimately approved).\nBars to Adjustment\nDepending on how you entered the United States or if you committed a particular act or violation of immigration law, you may be barred from adjusting status. You are ineligible to apply for adjustment of status if one or more bars to adjustment listed in\nsection 245(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)\napply to you. For more information, please see\nUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 7, Adjustment of Status, Part B, 245(a) Adjustment\n.\nApplying Under INA 245(i) (LIFE Act)\nYou may be able to adjust status under INA\n245(i)\neven if you are subject to one or more adjustment bars and are therefore ineligible for adjustment of status under INA\n245(a)\n. See the separate\nInstructions for Form I-485 Supplement A, Adjustment of Status Under Section 245(i)\nfor more information.\nGrounds of Inadmissibility\nTo qualify for a Green Card, you must be admissible to the United States. Reasons why you may be inadmissible are listed in the\nINA 212(a)\nand are called grounds of inadmissibility.\nIn general, USCIS can only approve your Green Card application only if none of the grounds of inadmissibility apply to you.\nIf you are inadmissible, the law may allow you to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief in your situation. See\nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility\nand\nForm I-212, Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States after Deportation or Removal\n. If a waiver or other form of relief is granted, USCIS may approve your application for a Green Card if you are otherwise eligible.\nWhether a waiver or other form of relief is available depends on the specific inadmissibility ground(s) that applies to you and the category you are adjusting under. Eligibility requirements for waivers and other forms of relief vary. For information on the grounds of inadmissibility and waivers, please see USCIS Policy Manual\nVolume 8, Admissibility\nand\nVolume 9, Waivers\n.\nHow to Apply\nIf you are currently in the United States, an immigrant visa is immediately available to you as an EB-1, EB-2, or EB-3 immigrant, and you meet certain other requirements, you may file\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n, to apply for a Green Card without leaving the country. This is called “adjustment of status.” If a visa is immediately available, you may file your Form I-485:\nTogether (“\nconcurrently\n”) with\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker\nfiled on your behalf;\nWhile the Form I-140 is pending; or\nAfter the Form I-140 is approved (and remains valid).\nFor information on visa availability, see\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\n,\nAdjustment of Status Filing Charts\n, and the Department of State website to view the\nVisa Bulletin\n.\nWhat to Submit (Principal Applicant)\nAs the named Form I-140 beneficiary, you are the applicant of the Form I-485 and supplements.

If you need to leave the United State temporarily while your Form I-485 is pending, please see the\nInstructions for Application for Travel Document\nfor more information.  Generally, if you have a pending Form I-485 and you leave the United States without an advance parole document, you will have abandoned your application.\nFor further information, see our\nEmployment Authorization\nand\nTravel Documents\npages.\nTransfer of Underlying Basis\nYou may be eligible, using the new mailing address below, to request to transfer the underlying basis of your\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n, to a different employment-based immigrant category based on another\nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers\n.\nUSCIS may, in its discretion, grant a transfer request if the following criteria are met:\nYou have continuously maintained eligibility for adjustment of status;\nYour adjustment of status application based on the original Form I-140 is still pending;\nYou are eligible for the new immigrant category; and\nYou have a visa immediately available in the new immigrant category.\nYou must request in writing that USCIS transfer the underlying basis of your pending Form I-485 to another immigrant category.\nIn certain instances, you should also submit a completed\nI-485 Supplement J, Confirmation of Valid Job Offer or Request for Job Portability Under INA Section 204(j)\nwith your transfer request. The purpose of the Supplement J is to confirm the validity of the job offered to you in the immigrant petition you want to use as the basis for your transfer request.\nIf you are requesting to transfer your underlying basis to a previously filed and approved Form I-140, you should submit Supplement J with your transfer request.\nIf you are requesting to transfer your underlying basis to a Form I-140 that remains pending, you do not need to submit Supplement J.\nIf a new Form I-140 is being filed on your behalf and you are eligible to concurrently file, you may request to transfer the underlying basis of your pending Form I-485 to this new petition. The petition must be submitted with a signed letter requesting that your pending Form I-485 be transferred to the new petition. It should include a coversheet (preferably highlighted with colored paper) stating “REQUEST FOR TRANSFER OF PENDING FORM I-485 [receipt number] TO ENCLOSED PETITION.”  You should include a copy of the Form I-485 receipt notice as well as evidence of eligibility in the new immigrant category. You do not need to submit Supplement J.\nUSCIS does not provide a written response to transfer requests. However, USCIS will issue receipt notices for the Supplement J.\nThe written request to transfer the underlying basis should at a minimum contain sufficient information for USCIS to identify the pending Form I-485 and the immigrant petition which you would like to use as the new basis for your application (for example, receipt number or A-Number).\nLocations for Submission of Transfer Request\nUSCIS has created a centralized location for receipt of transfer requests between the employment-based preference categories that are accompanied by a Supplement J.\nYou may submit your written request and completed Supplement J to:\nU.S. Postal Service (USPS):\nUSCIS\nAttn: Supp J\nPO Box 660834\nDallas, TX 75266-0834\nFedEx, UPS, and DHL deliveries:\nUSCIS\nAttn: Supp J (Box 660834)\n2501 S. State Hwy. 121 Business\nSuite 400\nLewisville, TX 75067-8003\nOnly transfer requests accompanied by a Supplement J should be sent to the above address, and applicants should send no other forms, documents, or evidence to this address.\nEmployment-based transfer requests that are not accompanied by a Supplement J should be submitted in writing to the USCIS office with jurisdiction over your pending I-485 application.\nApplicants may determine the USCIS office with jurisdiction over their application by referring to any receipt or transfer notices they have received, or by reaching out to the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283.\nTransfer requests accompanying a newly filed Form I-140 should not be sent to the address above or to the USCIS office with jurisdiction over your application, but instead should be sent to the normal filing location for the Form I-140.\nPlease check the\nDirect Filing Addresses for Form I-140\npage on our website.\nIf you have already submitted a transfer request to a USCIS office, you should not submit a new request. All requests to transfer the underlying basis already received or that will be received at a USCIS office will be processed as usual by the USCIS office with jurisdiction over your pending Form I-485.\nYou do not have to submit a new adjustment of status application or filing fee with a request to transfer the underlying basis of your Form I-485 from one petition to another. Submitting a new adjustment of status application is not required to transfer the underlying basis of a pending Form I-485 and will not result in faster adjudication of the benefit request.
