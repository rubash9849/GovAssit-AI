      "content": "Abused Spouses, Children and Parents\nThe family-based immigration process generally requires U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to file a petition for their alien family members. Some petitioners may misuse the immigration process to further abuse their alien family members by threatening to withhold or withdraw the petition in order to control, coerce, and intimidate them.\nWith the passage of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) and its subsequent reauthorizations, Congress provided aliens who have been abused by their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative the ability to independently petition for themselves (self-petition) for immigrant classification without the abuser’s knowledge, consent, or participation in the immigration process. This allows victims to seek both safety and independence from their abusers.\nSpouses and children of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, and parents of U.S. citizens who are 21 years of age or older, may file a self-petition for immigrant classification with USCIS. An alien filing the self-petition is generally known as a VAWA self-petitioner. If USCIS approves the self-petition, VAWA self-petitioners may seek legal permanent residence and obtain a Green Card.  This can be done either by consular processing if the approved self-petitioner is outside the United States or by applying for adjustment of status if the approved self-petitioner is in the United States.\nGet Help\nHelp and support is available to victims of domestic violence through the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE (7233) or 800-787-3224 (TTY). The hotline provides immediate assistance and support, and the website has information about local resources, shelters, medical and mental health services, legal help, and other types of assistance. For more information, visit the\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline\nwebsite.\nThose Eligible to File\nSpouse:\nYou may file for yourself if you are, or were, the abused spouse of a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. You may also file as an abused spouse if your child has been abused by your U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse.  You may also include on your petition your unmarried children who are under 21 if they have not filed for themselves.\nParent\n: You may file if you are the parent of a U.S. citizen, and you have been abused by your U.S. citizen son or daughter.\nChild\n: You may file for yourself if you are an abused child under 21, unmarried and have been abused by your U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. Your children may also be included on your petition. You may also file for yourself as a child after age 21 but before age 25 if you can demonstrate that the abuse was the main reason for the delay in filing.\nEligibility Requirements for a VAWA Self-Petition\nYou are eligible for a VAWA self-petition if you demonstrate the following eligibility requirements:\nYou have a qualifying relationship as the:\nSpouse, intended spouse, or former spouse of an abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident if:\nYou are married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident abuser;\nYour marriage to the abuser was legally terminated by death (U.S. citizen spouses only) or a divorce (for reasons related to the abuse) within the 2 years prior to filing your petition;\nYour spouse lost or renounced citizenship or permanent resident status within the 2 years prior to filing your petition due to an incident of domestic violence; or\nYou believed that you were legally married to your abusive U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse but the marriage was not legitimate solely because of the bigamy of your abusive spouse.\nChild of an abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident parent; or\nParent of an abusive U.S. citizen son or daughter who is 21 years old or older.\nYou were subjected to battery or extreme cruelty by your U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative during the qualifying relationship. (If you are applying as a spouse, you may also be eligible if your U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse subjected your child to battery or extreme cruelty);\nYou are residing or have resided with your abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative; and\nYou are a person of good moral character.\nIf you are self-petitioning as the spouse of an abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, then you must also demonstrate that you entered into the marriage in good faith and not for the purpose of evading immigration laws.\nIn certain circumstances you may remain eligible for the VAWA self-petition if your abusive relative lost or renounced their U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident status or if your abusive relative died.\nIf you are living outside of the United States at the time you file the self-petition, you must demonstrate one of the following in addition to the eligibility requirements listed above:\nYour abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative is an employee of the U.S. government;\nYour abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent relative is a member of the U.S. armed forces; or\nYou were subjected to battery or extreme cruelty in the United States.\nFor more information on VAWA self-petitions, see\nUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 3, Humanitarian Protection and Parole, Part D – Violence Against Women Act\n.\nFamily Members\nIf you are applying as a spouse or child of an abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, you may include your child(ren) as derivative beneficiaries on the self-petition. Children must be under 21 years old and unmarried when you file to be included as derivative beneficiaries. If you are applying as a parent of an abusive U.S. citizen son or daughter, however, you are not eligible to include derivative beneficiaries on your self-petition.\nIf the self-petition is approved, derivative beneficiaries are granted the same immigrant classification and priority date as the self-petitioner and are eligible to apply for lawful permanent resident status when a visa is immediately available. VAWA self-petitioners may add an eligible child, including a child born after the self-petition is approved, when the self-petitioner applies for lawful permanent resident status. They do not have to file a new petition.\nHow to Apply\nTo apply for a VAWA self-petition you must submit:\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\n(There is no fee to file Form I-360 as a VAWA self-petitioner.); and\nEvidence to demonstrate that you meet all eligibility requirements.\nIf you list derivative beneficiaries on your self-petition, provide evidence that any listed derivative beneficiary is under 21 years old and unmarried at the time of filing, as well as evidence of the relationship between you and your child.\nIf your Form I-360 is approved, it does not provide immigration status to you and your derivative beneficiaries. An approved Form I-360 provides immigrant classification so that you and your derivative beneficiaries may be eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence (obtain a Green Card).\nIf your Form I-360 is approved and you are in the United States, USCIS may consider you for deferred action on a case-by-case basis. Derivative beneficiaries requesting deferred action consideration must include a copy of the self-petitioner’s approval notice and evidence of a qualifying derivative relationship with the request to the Vermont Service Center.\nInterviews for Certain VAWA Self-Petitioners\nUSCIS has the authority to request that any individual filing for a benefit appear for an interview under 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(b)(9).\nIf you receive an interview notice, you must follow the instructions on your interview notice. At your interview, you should be prepared to discuss your eligibility for a VAWA self-petition and your eligibility for adjustment of status.\nBeing selected for an interview does not necessarily mean that a deficiency has been identified in your case, nor does it alter eligibility requirements or applicable evidentiary standards. However, failure to appear at your interview if you have received an interview notice may result in denial of the VAWA self-petition and application for adjustment of status.\nUSCIS will mail interview notices to a selected self-petitioner’s’ safe address and to their legal representative (if they have one on file). We will interview the self-petitioner at the USCIS field office with jurisdiction over the self-petitioner’s residence.  Officers with specialized training and experience, including trauma-informed interview techniques and confidentiality protections under 8 U.S.C. § 1367, will conduct these interviews.\nInterviews help USCIS ensure program effectiveness and integrity, improve USCIS assessment of program requirements, and preserve access to critical protections for victims of abuse.\nEligibility for Public Benefits\nIf you are self-petitioning as a spouse or child of an abusive U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident or are a derivative beneficiary, you are considered a “qualified alien” and eligible for certain federal and state public benefits if you can establish prima facie (initial review) eligibility for Form I-360 or have an approved Form I-360. Note that if you are self-petitioning as a parent of an abusive U.S. citizen son or daughter, you are not considered a “qualified alien” and are not eligible for public benefits as a “qualified alien.”\nIf you establish prima facie eligibility when you file Form I-360, USCIS will issue a Notice of Prima Facie Case (NPFC) to you.  You may use this document or notice of your approved Form I-360 to apply for certain public benefits.\nFor more information about public benefits and how to establish a prima facie eligibility, see:\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services –\nDomestic Violence Fact Sheet\nUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 3, Humanitarian Protection and Parole, Part D – Violence Against Women Act\nEmployment Authorization\nIf you have an approved Form I-360, you are eligible to apply to work in the United States.\nUSCIS will automatically consider you for employment authorization if you request an initial employment authorization document (EAD) by checking the appropriate box on Form I-360 and your Form I-360 is approved. You do not need to file a separate\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n. If you do not request an initial EAD on Form I-360, however, you must file Form I-765 after your Form I-360 is approved in order to apply for employment authorization and obtain an EAD. In addition, if you have an approved Form I-360 and have been placed in deferred action, you are eligible to apply to work in the United States. To apply to work in the United States, you must file the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization with the Vermont Service Center.\nYour derivative children may also apply for work authorization after your Form I-360 is approved.  Derivative children must file\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, to request an EAD.\nApplying for a Green Card\nIf you have an approved Form I-360 and meet certain other requirements, you may apply for a\nGreen Card\n. Your derivative children may also apply for a Green Card.\nIf you are currently in the United States and an immigrant visa is immediately available to you, you may file\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n, to apply for a Green Card without leaving the country. If a visa is immediately available, you may file your Form I-485:\nTogether (“\nconcurrently\n”) with\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\n;\nWhile the Form I-360 is pending; or\nAfter Form I-360 is approved (and remains valid).\nFor more information on visa availability, see\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\n,\nAdjustment of Status Filing Charts\n, and the Department of State website to view the\nVisa Bulletin\n.\nIf you are outside the United States, USCIS will send your VAWA self-petition to the National Visa Center (NVC). The NVC will forward your petition to the appropriate U.S. Consulate when a visa becomes available, and you will be notified about how to proceed. This process is referred to as “consular processing.”\nCase Inquiries\nFor information about ways to contact USCIS, see the “Inquiries for VAWA, T, and U Filings (Including Form I-751 Abuse Waivers)” section on our\nContact Us\nwebpage.\nFor information about how to change your address, see our\nChange of Address Procedures for VAWA/T/U Cases and Form I-751 Abuse Waivers\nwebpage.\nRelated Links\nMore Information\nImmigration Options for Victims of Crimes Brochure\nHow Receiving Public Benefits Might Impact the Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility (“Public Assistance Access for Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Survivors”) Fact Sheet\nForms\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\nForm I-485, Application to Register for Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\nUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 3, Humanitarian Protection and Parole, Part D – Violence Against Women Act\nGreen Card for VAWA Self-Petitioner\nNon-USCIS Links\nDepartment of State: The Visa Bulletin\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n01/24/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

You must file\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, to apply for re-parole before your parole period expires. We encourage you to file Form I-131 using an online account. Please see the\nRe-Parole Process for Certain Afghans\nwebpage for more information about filing online.\nAlert Type info\nALERT:\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has issued\nupdated guidance\nclarifying that ORR benefits and services will be available to eligible Afghan parolees who have a pending re-parole application, a pending asylum application, or a pending adjustment of status application with USCIS. This guidance applies to eligible Afghan parolees whose initial period of parole expires while their applications are pending with USCIS.\nWe will accept and consider, on a case-by-case basis, re-parole requests under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) from certain alien Afghan nationals. Eligible Afghan nationals either:\nWere initially paroled into the United States with an “OAR” or “PAR” class of admission on their Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record (even if they subsequently traveled with advance parole and received a different class of admission when they were paroled back into the United States); or\nTheir Form I-94 class of admission has been updated to “OAR” or “PAR.”*\nFor information regarding fees and fee exemptions, please see\nForm G-1055\n.\nThrough Jan. 31, 2025, these re-parole requests (\nfrom self-petitioners only\n) are exempt from:\nThe Form I-131 filing fee to apply for re-parole;\nThe filing fee for the associated Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization; and\nThe requirement to file Form I-134, Declaration of Financial Support, with Form I-131.\nFor information regarding fees and fee exemptions, please see\nForm G-1055\n.\n*Individuals who received their Form I-94 from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) when they were paroled into the United States should visit the\nCBP Form I-94\nwebsite to view and print a copy of their current Form I-94, which will be updated if their request for re-parole is approved. CBP has\ninstructions\non how to look up your Form I-94.\nBefore you file a request for re-parole, you may need to contact CBP to update your class of admission, if you did not receive an “OAR” or “PAR” class of admission on your Form I-94 and you:\nAre an Afghan national who was paroled into the United States between July 31, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2023;\nWere paroled into the United States after Sept. 30, 2023, and are the spouse or child of an individual paroled into the United States between July 31, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2023;\nor\nAre the parent or legal guardian of an individual who was paroled into the United States between July 31, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2023, as an unaccompanied child.\nTo contact CBP, go to CBP’s\nI-94 OAW Questions\nwebpage.

Considering the time necessary for Afghan parolees seeking permanent status in the United States to accomplish the purpose of their parole and regularize their immigration status, DHS plans to consider them on a case-by-case basis for an extension of their initial parole period.\nIf DHS approves an extension of your initial parole period, we will also extend your original employment authorization validity dates. We will send a Form I-797C, Notice of Additional Action, to your last address of record with USCIS. This Form I-797C, together with your original Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD), will serve as proof of your extended employment authorization dates. If you receive notice that your initial parole period has been extended, and you would like an updated EAD that reflects your new employment authorization dates, you may file a new Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, using category c(11).

If you did not complete Form I-765 at a safe haven or did not answer “Yes” to both Item Number 14 and Item Number 15 allowing USCIS to disclose your personal information on the Form I-765 filed separately, you will need to apply for a Social Security number and card using the instructions at the Social Security Administration’s\nRequest Social Security number for the first time\nwebpage.\nActions to take if you are filing for fee-exempt re-parole and EAD on or after June 8, 2023\nIf you are\nThen\nAn eligible Afghan national who has not yet filed Form I-131 to request re-parole and wants to file through the streamlined process\nonline\nSubmit\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n(completed and signed) without fee.\nYou must enter “OAR” or “PAR” in the Class of Admission question.\nYou must request re-parole for yourself by selecting 10.B.. in Part 1 to indicate you are seeking re-parole under the streamlined re-parole process for certain Afghan nationals.\nIf you are helping a minor file for re-parole, select 10.B. in Part 1 and list the minor as the applicant.\nIf you are also requesting an EAD with a new period of parole, please check the box for Part 9, Item 1, “I am requesting an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) upon approval of my new period of parole (re-parole) selected under Part 1., Item Number 10. or 11.”  Do not submit Form I-765.\nAn eligible Afghan national who has not yet filed Form I-131 to request re-parole and wants to file through the streamlined process\non paper\nSubmit\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n(completed and signed) without fee.\nYou must request re-parole for yourself by selecting “10.B.” in Part 1.\nIf you are helping a minor file for re-parole, select 10.B in Part 1 and list the minor as the applicant.\nIf you are also requesting an EAD with a new period of parole, please check the box for Part 9, Item 1, “I am requesting an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) upon approval of my new period of parole (re-parole) selected under Part 1., Item Number 10. or 11.” Do not submit Form I-765.\nActions to take if you filed for re-parole before June 8, 2023\nIf you are\nThen\nAn eligible Afghan national who previously filed a Form I-131 online or by paper to request re-parole before June 8, 2023\nYou may submit a new request using the streamlined process announced in this message to receive the fee-exemption and concurrent EAD processing. If you submit a new request under this streamlined process, you may withdraw your pending request by emailing\nParoleOperations@uscis.dhs.gov\n.

However, some of the content may still be useful, so we have archived the page.\nThank you for visiting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) online and reviewing our website privacy policy. USCIS is a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Our privacy policy explains how we handle the personally identifiable information (PII) that you provide to us when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. PII includes information that is personal in nature and which may be used to identify you. You may provide PII to us when you email us or send a request for information, when you fill out a questionnaire or satisfaction survey, when you participate in a research study, etc. We do not require you to register or provide PII to visit our website. We do collect some technical information that does not include PII when you visit to make your visit seamless. The section below explains how we handle and collect information when you visit\nwww.uscis.gov\n.\nThe PII you provide on a DHS website will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it. We will protect your information consistent with the principles of the\nPrivacy Act of 1974\n, the\nE-Government Act of 2002\n, and the\nFederal Records Act\n.\nPersonally Identifiable Information\nAs a general rule, DHS does not collect PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving DHS your permission to use the information for a specific, stated purpose. However, not providing certain information may prevent us from providing you with the service you desire.\nIf you choose to provide us with PII on a DHS website, through such methods as completing a web form, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or service you have requested. The information we may receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.\nWe only share the PII you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give your PII to any private organizations. We never collect information for commercial marketing.\nIf we store your PII in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.), so that we may contact you, we will safeguard the information you provide to us in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). The Privacy Act requires all public-facing sites or forms that request PII to prominently and conspicuously display a privacy notice.\nThe notice must address the following criteria:\nLegal authorization to collect information about you;\nPurpose for which the information will be used;\nRoutine uses for disclosure of information outside of the Department of Homeland Security;\nWhether your providing the information is voluntary or mandatory under law; and\nResults if you choose to not provide the requested information.\nFor the general contact information that may be submitted through\nwww.uscis.gov\n, we have completed a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and System of Records Notice (SORN) providing details about the privacy protections and redress options available for the contact information we collect from the public. We may use this information to provide you with information and to perform various administrative tasks. For further information, please reference the privacy compliance documentation below:\nDHS/ALL/PIA-006\nDepartment of Homeland Security General Contact Lists  (PDF)\nPrivacy Impact Assessment (April 25, 2019)\nDHS/ALL-002\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Mailing and Other Lists\nSystem of Records Notice (November 25, 2008, 73 FR 71659)\nEmail Communications\nMany of our programs and websites allow you to send us email messages. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry. We will only send you general information via email. You should be reminded that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. Therefore, we suggest that you do not send sensitive PII (such as your Social Security number) to us via email. If your intended email communication is sensitive, e.g., it includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or Social Security number, you should instead send it by U.S. mail. You may also submit data through a secure program website, if available.\nElectronic mail messages that meet the definition of records in the\nFederal Records Act\n(44 U.S.C. § 3101) are covered under the same disposition schedule as all other federal records. This means that emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for varying periods of time if those emails meet the definition of federal records. Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer needed.\nInformation Collected and Stored Automatically\nWhen you browse through any website, certain information about your visit can be collected. We automatically collect the following types of information about your visit:\nDomain from which you access the Internet;\nIP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when navigating the internet);\nOperating system and information about the device or browser used when visiting the site;\nDate and time of your visit;\nContent you visited or downloaded; and,\nWebsite (such as google.com or bing.com) or referral source (email notice or social media site) that connected you to the website.\nDHS uses a variety of different web measurement software tools.\nDHS uses Google Analytics measurement software to collect the information listed above. The data are automatically sent to Google’s system and the system immediately aggregates the data. Neither DHS nor Google ever have access to the specifics of your particular site visits. The staff can only see the aggregate data from all users for a particular time period.\nDHS gathers this information to improve our websites and has chosen to not share the aggregate data with Google. We may use the aggregated data to share with our partners and contractors to help improve visitor experiences.\nDHS also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors. DHS uses the Foresee Results American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey to obtain feedback and data on visitors’ satisfaction with DHS websites. This survey does not collect PII. Participation in the survey is voluntary. If you decline to take the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources on the website as those who take the survey. Answers to the survey help us improve our website to make it easier to use and more responsive to the needs of our visitors.\nDHS staff conduct analyses and reports on the aggregated data from the ACSI survey. The reports are only available to website managers, members of their communications and web teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.\nDHS retains the data from Google Analytics, and ACSI survey results only as long as required by law or needed to support the mission of the DHS websites.\nOmnichannel Survey\nPaperwork Reduction Act Statement\nAn agency may not conduct or sponsor an information collection and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated at 5 minute per response. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to: External Affairs Directorate, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 5900 Capital Gateway Drive – Mail Stop 2040, Camp Springs, MD 20588-0009. OMB No. 1615-0121. Do not return a completed form to this address.\nDHS Privacy Notice\nAUTHORITIES: The information requested on this survey, and the associated evidence, is collected under the Immigration and Nationality Act sections [101, 103, 221,245.; Public Law 103-62 “Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA);” Public Law 111-352 “Government Performance and Results Modernization Act of 2010”; Public Law 107-347 “E-Government Act of 2002”; 31 U.S. Code § 1115, “Federal Government and agency performance plans”.\nPURPOSE: The primary purpose for providing the requested information on this survey is to provide USCIS with the feedback to make improvements to the services provided to the public.\nDISCLOSURE: The information you provide is voluntary.\nHow the Department Uses Cookies\nThe Office of Management and Budget Memo\nM-10-22, Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies (PDF)\nallows federal agencies to use session and persistent cookies.\nWhen you visit any website, its server may generate a piece of text known as a \"cookie\" to place on your computer. Placing cookie text allows websites to “remember” visitors’ preferences, surfing patterns and behavior while they are connected.\nThe cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features of web pages. Cookies from our web pages only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect any personal information about you.\nThere are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.\nSession Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as \"Usage Tier 1-Single Session.” The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.\"\nPersistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies to enable Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning visitors to our site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to our sites for six months. We also use persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey. The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as \"Usage Tier 2-Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected.\"\nIf you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can\nopt out or disable cookies\nin your browser. You will still have access to all information and resources at DHS websites. However, turning off cookies may affect the functioning of some DHS websites. Be aware that disabling cookies in your browser will affect cookie usage at all other websites you visit as well.\nFor additional information about the DHS’s use of Google Analytics, please see our privacy impact assessment, DHS/ALL/PIA-033\nGoogle Analytics  (PDF)\n(June 9, 2011).\nThird-Party Websites and Applications\nDHS uses social media websites and other kinds of third-party websites. We use social media websites to engage in dialogue, share information and media, and collaborate with the public. We may also use these websites to make information and services widely available, while promoting transparency and accountability, as a service for those seeking information about or services from DHS. The privacy policies for approved social media platforms are linked to the right of this privacy policy. We have have also published two Privacy Impact Assessments detailing our use of social media:\nDHS/ALL/PIA-031\nUse of Social Networking Interactions and Applications Communications/Outreach/Public Dialogue  (PDF)\n(September 16, 2010)\nDHS/ALL/PIA-036\nUse of Unidirectional Social Media Applications  (PDF)\n(March 8, 2011)\nDHS does not use third-party websites to solicit and collect PII from individuals. DHS will not transmit or store any PII collected by the third-party website; no PII will be disclosed, sold or transferred to any other entity outside DHs, unless required for law enforcement purposes or by statute consistent with the Privacy Act.\nSite Security\nDHS takes the security of all PII very seriously. We take precautions to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we collect at this site. Such measures include access controls designed to limit access to the information to the extent necessary to accomplish our mission. We also employ various security technologies to protect the information stored on our systems. We routinely test our security measures to ensure that they remain operational and effective.\nFor site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.\nExcept for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.\nUnauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.\nInteraction with Children Online\nDHS is committed to the protection of children’s online privacy. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. If a DHS website intends to collect information from children under 13 years old, COPPA-required information and instructions will be provided by the specific web page that collects information about the child. The web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.\nVisiting Other Websites\nOur website contains links to international agencies, private organizations, and some commercial entities. These websites are not within our control and may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility polices. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the policies of that site. All federal websites, however, are subject to the same federal policy, security, and accessibility mandates.\nPrivacy Policy Contact Information\nWe welcome feedback if you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or the use of your information.

If you have been persecuted or have a fear of future persecution because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, you may be eligible for asylum.\nThe law requires applicants for asylum to apply within 1 year of their last arrival to the United States, unless they can show that they qualify for an exception to the 1-year filing deadline. You can qualify for an exception if you can show:\nThere are changed circumstances materially affecting your eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances directly related to your delay in filing an application for asylum; and\nYou filed the application within a reasonable period of time given those circumstances.\nGenerally, maintaining valid status or parole until a reasonable period before filing the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance. You may be eligible for the extraordinary circumstances exception to the 1-year filing deadline if you file for asylum while your parole is still valid. (Your parole will not be valid if you violate its terms.) If you file your asylum application after your parole expires, you may still qualify for an exception to the 1-year filing deadline if you filed for asylum within a reasonable period of time after your parole expired. For more information, see the\nOne-Year Filing Deadline Lesson Plan\n. For more information on asylum, see the\nObtaining Asylum in the United States\nwebpage. More asylum-related information for Afghan parolees is available at\nAfghan Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) Parolee Asylum-Related Frequently Asked Questions\n.\nIf you have an asylum application pending with USCIS, you can check your\nCase Status Online\n. You will need the receipt number we provided you after you filed your application. For inquiries regarding pending asylum applications, you or your attorney of record should contact the asylum office with jurisdiction over the case. To find information about an asylum office, visit the\nUSCIS Service and Office Locator\n.\nWe are expediting pending affirmative asylum applications filed by certain Afghan applicants. Under the\nExtending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act  (PDF)\n, we are prioritizing asylum applications filed by certain Afghan citizens and nationals, or those with no nationality who last habitually resided in Afghanistan, as defined in Section 2502(a) of the Act (see section Operation Allies Welcome – Expeditious Processing for Asylum Applications below for further information). Under Section 2502(c) of the Act, we will conduct the initial interview for an asylum application within 45 days of filing and, if there are no exceptional circumstances, we will complete the final adjudication within 150 days of filing.\nFor aliens who are not covered under the\nExtending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act  (PDF)\n, we will prioritize affirmative asylum applications within the parameters indicated on the general\nAffirmative Asylum Interview Scheduling\nwebpage. Asylum office directors may consider, on a case-by-case basis, an urgent request for an asylum interview, including when you have an immediate family member in danger of harm in the country of claimed persecution. Please submit any urgent interview scheduling requests in writing to the asylum office with jurisdiction over your case.

In the past, we relied on receiving these paper packets to issue Permanent Resident Cards (Green Cards). We are working with other agencies to ensure we receive the information we need in a timely manner to issue Green Cards promptly. In the meantime, we have identified specific individuals affected by the missing visa packets, and we are mailing Green Cards to the addresses we have on file for them.\nIf you were admitted to the United States as an Afghan SIV LPR more than 90 days ago, and you have not received a Green Card, please contact us using the\nCase Inquiry\nwebpage.\nIf you are a CQ conditional immigrant or SQ immigrant affected by a missing visa packet, you may receive a USCIS Application Support Center appointment notice to submit your biometrics (photograph or fingerprints or both).

For more information, see the\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n, webpage and the\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\nwebpage.\nThrough Sept. 30, 2025, there is no fee to file Form I-130 for an Afghan national (beneficiary) with a visa immediately available. Please include your relative’s country of birth on Part 4, Item 7., of the Form I-130. To learn the fees for petitions filed at a U.S. embassy or consulate, contact the specific embassy or consulate. If you are a petitioner or attorney of record with a Form G-28 on file and you have questions about a pending Form I-130 petition for family-based immigration, contact the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833), Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern. If you are outside the United States, call 212-620-3418 or check your\nCase Status Online\n.\nFollow - to- Join\nFor Spouses and Children of SIV LPRS\nSome Afghan lawful permanent residents who adjusted status as Afghan special immigrants (SIV LPRs) under the OAW effort may seek follow-to-join immigration benefits for their spouses and children outside the United States. Use\nForm I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition\n, to request further action on a previously approved application or petition. A spouse or unmarried child younger than 21 years old who is following to join a principal immigrant may receive the same special immigrant classification as a principal Afghan special immigrant. There is no filing fee for an Afghan special immigrant filing Form I-824.\nFor Spouses and Children of a Refugee or Asylee\nIf you are a principal refugee admitted to the United States within the past 2 years or a principal asylee who was granted asylum within the past 2 years, you may use\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition\n, to request follow-to-join immigration benefits for your qualifying spouse or unmarried children under 21 years of age. This is considered “derivative” refugee or asylee status because your beneficiary will be deriving their status from you after you were admitted to the United States as a refugee or received a grant of asylum. This petition has a 2-year filing deadline. However, in some cases, USCIS may waive the 2-year filing deadline for humanitarian reasons. For more information, see the\nForm I-730\nwebpage.\nAfghan National Parolees - Reunification for Immediate Family Members\nThe U.S. government may be able to offer departure assistance for your eligible family members who are outside the United States if you are an Afghan national who entered the United States on or after Aug. 14, 2021.\nIf you are an adult, you may be eligible to apply for your lawful spouse* and your unmarried children under the age of 21 to enter the United States as refugees. If you were under age 21 as of Aug. 14, 2021, you may be eligible to request departure assistance for your parents, legal guardians, or unmarried siblings who were under age 21 as of Aug. 14, 2021.\nVisit the Department of State’s\nAfghanistan Family Reunification\nwebpage and navigate to the If You Are a Parolee section for more detailed information. This section has a link to\nForm DS-4317, Family Reunification Assistance for Afghan Parolees' Immediate Family Members Outside the United States\n, which you may use to apply for your eligible family members.\n*Please note that, generally, we will consider only the first lawful marriage of a polygamous marriage valid for U.S. immigration purposes, unless you provide a divorce certificate or death certificate as evidence that the first marriage has ended, along with a marriage certificate for any subsequent marriage. For more information, see the Polygamous Marriages section.\nIf the U.S. government can help your eligible family members depart Afghanistan, your family members will travel to a country outside the United States where they can be considered for an immigrant pathway such as refugee status through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The Department of State will contact you with departure options for your family members\nafter\nreceiving your Form DS-4317. If the U.S. government helps your family members depart Afghanistan, they will only be able to enter the United States if U.S. immigration officials approve their entry.\nYou should\nnot\ntravel to Afghanistan to accompany your family members. The U.S. government does not require you to be in Afghanistan to help your family members depart and will not help your family members depart more quickly if you are there.\nFiling Form DS-4317 will not prevent you from filing\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition\n, if you are granted asylum or refugee status in the United States. If we approve your Form I-730 for a beneficiary who is in Afghanistan, that beneficiary may be able to receive relocation assistance and continued processing in a third country for ultimate relocation in the United States.\nUSCIS Immigrant Fee\nWe generally require a fee to process the associated immigrant visa packets and produce Green Cards. Through Sept. 30, 2025, we will not charge an immigrant fee to Afghan nationals.\nSocial Security Number and Card\nWe encourage you to apply for a Social Security number (SSN) using\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, and following the form instructions. If you request an SSN in Part 2 (Items 13.a.-17.b.) of your Form I-765, and we approve your application for employment authorization, we will send that information to the Social Security Administration (SSA), and SSA will assign you an SSN and issue you a Social Security card. SSA will mail your Social Security card directly to the address you provide on Form I-765.\nIf you do not request an SSN on your Form I-765, or you did not complete Form I-765 at a U.S. government reception center or safe haven, you can apply for an SSN after you receive your EAD from USCIS using the instructions on SSA’s\nSocial Security Number and Card\nwebpage.\nPolygamous Marriages\nPolygamy is the religious practice or historical custom of having more than 1 spouse at the same time. Polygamous marriages are legal under Afghan law, but they are illegal in all states in the United States. U.S. law does not recognize polygamous marriages. Individuals should not continue to practice polygamy in the United States.\nGenerally, we will only consider the first marriage of a polygamous marriage valid for immigration purposes. If you continue a polygamous marriage you were in before you came to the United States or begin a new polygamous marriage in the United States, we may deny your immigration application or petition.\nIf you have questions about polygamous marriage and U.S. immigration law, contact your\nlocal resettlement agency\n. If you need to find legal services, please visit the\nFind Legal Services\nwebpage.\nInformation for Unaccompanied Children\nIn general, an unaccompanied child is a person under the age of 18 who does not have lawful immigration status in the United States and who does not have a parent or legal guardian in the United States who can provide care and physical custody.\nFor more information on available programs and services to support such children, contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) Hotline for Unaccompanied Children and Sponsors: 800-203-7001,\ninformation@ORRNCC.com\n, or visit ORR’s webpages on the\nUnaccompanied Children (UC) Program\nand the\nUnaccompanied Refugee Minors Program (URM)\n.\nResources for Victims of Abuse, Violence or Exploitation\nThere are many forms of abuse and exploitation, including domestic violence, forced marriage and human trafficking. In the United States, there are laws that may help you avoid or escape an abusive situation or forced marriage.\nDomestic Violence\nis a pattern of behavior in a relationship that is used to gain or maintain power and control over an intimate partner, parent, or child. Domestic abuse can involve physical, sexual, emotional, financial, or psychological abuse or threats.\nForced Marriage\nmeans a marriage with 1 or more elements of force, fraud, or coercion and where 1 or both parties do not or cannot consent to the marriage. Consent means that you have given your full, free, and informed agreement to marry your intended spouse and to the timing of the marriage. Forced marriage may occur when family members or others use physical or emotional abuse, threats, or deception to force you to marry without your consent. For additional information on forced marriage, please visit the\nForced Marriage\nwebpage.\nHuman Trafficking\ninvolves exploiting someone to compel a commercial sex act or forced labor. Generally, this exploitation must involve force, fraud, or coercion to be considered human trafficking. However, if someone under 18 years old is induced to perform a commercial sex act, that is considered human trafficking even if there is no force, fraud, or coercion.\nIf you have experienced forced marriage, domestic violence, human trafficking, or other abuse, please contact the resources below to receive free help in your language:\nNational Domestic Violence Hotline:\n800-799-7233, 800-787-3224 (TTY),\nwww.ndvh.org\nNational Sexual Assault Hotline of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN):\n800-656-4673,\nwww.rainn.org\nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children:\n800-843-5678,\nwww.missingkids.com\nThe National Center for Victims of Crime:\n800-394-2255, 800-211-7996 (TTY),\nhttps://victimsofcrime.org\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline:\n888-373-7888, Text: 233733\nAfghan National Parolee Vaccination Status and Immigration Medical Examinations\nAs an Afghan parolee who received the Afghan Parole Information sheet from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) when you arrived in the United States or a Notice Regarding Conditions for Parole from a U.S. embassy consular officer, your parole is subject to certain medical conditions.\nIf you did not either complete these medical requirements before you traveled to the United States or complete a medical exam at a U.S. government reception center or safe haven after you arrived in the United States, you must receive the required testing and vaccinations elsewhere.

      "content": "Special Immigrant Juveniles\nAlert Type info\nALERT:\nEffective June 6, 2025, USCIS rescinded the policy of categorically considering deferred action for special immigrant juveniles with an approved Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant, when an immigrant visa number is not immediately available. See the\nPolicy Aler\nt for more information.\nIf you are in the United States and need the protection of a juvenile court because you have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by a parent, you may be eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) classification. If SIJ classification is granted, you may qualify for lawful permanent residency (also known as getting a Green Card).\nEligibility for SIJ Classification\nYou must meet all of the statutory requirements outlined below to be eligible for SIJ classification. The requirements are in\nINA § 101(a)(27)(J)\n;\n8 CFR § 204.11\n; and\nUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part J- Special Immigrant Juveniles\n.\nYou Must:\nWhen?\nBe under 21 years of age.\nOnly at the time you file the SIJ petition (Form I-360).\nBe currently living in the United States. You cannot apply from outside the country to come to the United States on SIJ classification.\nBoth at the time you file the SIJ petition and at the time USCIS decides on your petition.\nBe unmarried. This means you either:\nHave never been married; or\nWere previously married, but the marriage ended in annulment, divorce, or death.\nBoth at the time you file the SIJ petition and at the time USCIS decides on your petition.\nHave a valid juvenile court order issued by a state court in the United States which finds that:\nYou are dependent on the court, or in the custody of a state agency or department or an individual or entity appointed by the court;\nYou cannot be reunified with one or both of your parents because of\nany\nof the following:\nAbuse;\nAbandonment;\nNeglect; or\nA similar basis under state law;\nand\nIt is not in your best interests to return to the country of nationality or last habitual residence of you or your parents.\nNote: Some juvenile courts may only be able to issue a juvenile court order if you are under 18 years of age.\nBoth at the time you file the SIJ petition and at the time USCIS decides on your petition.\nExceptions: You do not need to currently be under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court that issued your order if the court’s jurisdiction ended solely because:\nYou were adopted or placed in a permanent guardianship; or\nYou aged out of the juvenile court’s jurisdiction.\nBe eligible for USCIS consent. This means that you must have sought the juvenile court order to obtain relief from abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law and not primarily to obtain an immigration benefit.\nAt the time USCIS decides on your petition.\nHave written consent from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)/ Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to the court’s jurisdiction if:\nYou are currently in the custody of HHS, AND\nThe juvenile court order also changes your custody status or placement.\nAt the time USCIS decides on your petition.\nPlease see the\nOffice of Refugee Resettlement\nwebsite for instructions on obtaining HHS consent.\nState Juvenile Court Orders\nFor establishing eligibility for SIJ classification, a juvenile court is a court in the United States that has jurisdiction under state law to make judicial determinations about the dependency or custody and care of juveniles. The title and the type of court that may meet the definition of a juvenile court will vary from state to state.\nState juvenile courts issue orders and make decisions based on\nstate law\nabout dependency or custody; whether a juvenile has been abused, neglected, abandoned, or subject to similar maltreatment and consequently cannot be reunified with their parent(s); and the best interests of the juvenile. USCIS does not require that a juvenile court have the legal authority to place a child in the custody of an unfit parent in order to make a qualifying reunification determination for SIJ classification.\nThe court order or supplemental evidence submitted, however, must establish that the court had jurisdiction to make judicial determinations about the SIJ petitioner’s dependency or custody and care as a juvenile under the relevant state laws.\nAlthough state courts have the authority to provide certain protections for children under state law, they do not have the authority to administer or enforce provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Only USCIS can grant or deny SIJ classification or lawful permanent residence (a Green Card).\nRequired Determinations in the State Court Order\nThe juvenile court order must contain the required determinations made under relevant state law regarding dependency or custody, parental reunification, and best interests. You must submit evidence of a reasonable factual basis for each of the judicial determinations as well as the relief from parental maltreatment ordered by the juvenile court.\nYou can find more information about the eligibility requirements for SIJ classification and the court orders in the\nUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 6, Part J – Special Immigrant Juveniles.\nHow to Petition for SIJ Classification (Form I-360)\nTo petition for SIJ classification, you must file the following forms and supporting documentation with USCIS:\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\nEvidence of your age\n. You must submit 1 of the following (also submit a certified English translation, if applicable):\nBirth certificate;\nPassport;\nOfficial identity document issued by a foreign government, such as a cartilla or a cedula; or\nOther documents that satisfactorily establish your age.\nValid juvenile court order(s)\nthat make the required determinations and include or are supported by evidence of the factual basis for the court’s determinations.\nWritten\nconsent\n(PDF)\nfrom the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nOffice of Refugee Resettlement\nif you are in HHS custody and the juvenile court order also changes your custody status or placement.\nForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative\n, if you have an attorney or accredited representative who represents you.\nFiling SIJ Form I-360 In Person Before Your 21st Birthday\nYou must file\nForm I-360\nfor SIJ classification before your 21st birthday. See\n8 CFR 204.11(b)\n.\nYou (or your attorney or accredited representative) may contact the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 or chat with “Emma,” our virtual assistant (click “Connect to Live Agent”) to request an SIJ expedite appointment with a USCIS field office to file Form I-360 in person within the 2 weeks before your 21st birthday. At the appointment, the field office will accept your Form I-360 and date-stamp the first page. The field office will give you a photocopy of the first page of your Form I-360 and will send the form and any supporting documents to the USCIS Lockbox for receipting.\nThe USCIS Lockbox will follow standard receipting procedures. They may reject your Form I-360 if you file it improperly (for example, if you do not sign it). If the USCIS Lockbox receipts your Form I-360, they will issue a Form I-797, Notice of Action, using the date the USCIS field office physically received your Form I-360 as the receipt date.\nGreen Card Based on SIJ Classification (Form I‑485)\nIf you have been granted SIJ classification (which means we approved your Form I-360 petition), you may be eligible to apply for a Green Card by filing\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n. This is also known as applying for lawful permanent resident status or adjustment of status.\nPetition and Application Processing\nIf an immigrant visa is immediately available, you may generally file your Form I-360 and Form I-485 at the same time. Immigrant visas for SIJs come from the employment-based fourth preference (EB-4) immigrant visa category for special immigrants. For more information on immigrant visa availability, go to our\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\npage.\nIf an immigrant visa is not available, you may still file your Form I-360, but you will need to wait to file your Form I-485. Go to the\nGreen Card Based on Special Immigrant Juvenile Classification\npage for more information.\nAfter You File\nAfter you file your Form I-360, USCIS will:\nSend you a Notice of Action, which is your receipt showing the official filing date and receipt number.\nContact you for additional evidence if we need it to decide on your case.\nIf you have also filed your Form I-485, USCIS will:\nSend you a notice for an appointment to have your fingerprints and photographs taken (also known as biometrics).\nAsk you to submit\nForm I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record\n, if you did not submit it with Form I-485, or if you previously submitted it but the medical exam has\nexpired.\nContact you for additional evidence or for an interview with an immigration services officer, if needed, to decide on your case.\nNote: When you apply for SIJ classification or for a Green Card based on SIJ classification, we will not require you to contact the individual or family members of the individual who abused, abandoned, or neglected you.\nDecisions\nUSCIS generally makes decisions on SIJ petitions within 180 days (about 6 months) from your official filing date.\nWhile USCIS generally adjudicates\nForm I-360\npetitions for SIJ classification within 180 days, this time frame does not apply to\nForm I-485\n.\nSIJ Petition (Form I-360)\nIf we approve your SIJ petition, we will send you an approval notice.\nIf we deny your SIJ petition, we will send you a written decision telling you why and how you can appeal the decision.\nPrevious Grants of Deferred Action\nIf USCIS previously granted deferred action to an alien with SIJ classification in the exercise of discretion, the alien’s deferred action remains valid for the authorized period, unless terminated by USCIS, on case-by-case basis, as a matter of discretion.\nUSCIS will not consider requests for renewal of deferred action for aliens with SIJ classification who remain ineligible to apply for adjustment of status because an immigrant visa number is not immediately available.\nUSCIS reserves the right to terminate prior grants of deferred action and revoke the related employment authorization as a matter of discretion.\nGreen Card Based on SIJ Classification (Form I-485)\nIf we approve your Green Card application, we will send you an approval notice. You become a lawful permanent resident on the date we approve your Form I-485. The approval date will appear in the approval notice mailed to you and on your Green Card (also called a Permanent Resident Card or Form I-551).\nIf we deny your application, we will send you a written decision telling you why.

      "content": "Temporary Protected Status\nAlert Type info\nALERT\n: After reviewing country conditions and consulting with the appropriate U.S. government agencies, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem determined that Venezuela no longer meets the conditions for its designation for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and that the termination of the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation is required as it is contrary to the national interest. On October 3, 2025, the Supreme Court allowed the termination to take immediate effect. TPS beneficiaries who received an Employment Authorization Document on or before February 5, 2025, with a ‘Card Expires’ date of October 2, 2026, will maintain work authorization until October 2, 2026.\nSeparately, Secretary Noem published her notice to terminate the Venezuela 2021 designation, which is effective on Nov. 7, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. See Termination of the 2021 Designation of Venezuela for Temporary Protected Status, 90 Fed. Reg. 43225 (Sept. 8, 2025).\nAdditional information is available on the\nTPS Venezuela\npage. Be aware that litigation related updates are possible and check that page for the latest information.\nWhat is TPS\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security may designate a foreign country for TPS due to conditions in the country that temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately. USCIS may grant TPS to eligible nationals of certain countries (or parts of countries), who are already in the United States. Eligible individuals without nationality who last resided in the designated country may also be granted TPS.\nThe Secretary may designate a country for TPS due to the following temporary conditions in the country:\nOngoing armed conflict (such as civil war)\nAn environmental disaster (such as earthquake or hurricane), or an epidemic\nOther extraordinary and temporary conditions\nDuring a designated period, individuals who are TPS beneficiaries or who are found preliminarily eligible for TPS upon initial review of their cases (\nprima facie\neligible):\nAre not removable from the United States\nCan obtain an employment authorization document (EAD)\nMay be granted travel authorization\nOnce granted TPS, an individual also cannot be detained by DHS on the basis of his or her immigration status in the United States.\nTPS is a temporary benefit that does not lead to lawful permanent resident status or give any other immigration status. However, registration for TPS does not prevent you from:\nApplying for nonimmigrant status\nFiling for adjustment of status based on an immigrant petition\nApplying for any other immigration benefit or protection for which you may be eligible\nPLEASE NOTE: To be granted any other immigration benefit you must still meet all the eligibility requirements for that particular benefit.  An application for TPS does not affect an application for asylum or any other immigration benefit and vice versa. Denial of an application for asylum or any other immigration benefit does not affect your ability to register for TPS, although the grounds of denial of that application may also lead to denial of TPS.\nCountries Currently Designated for TPS\nSelect the country link for additional specific country information.\nBurma (Myanmar)\nEl Salvador\nEthiopia\nHaiti\nLebanon\nSomalia\nSouth Sudan\nSudan\nSyria\nUkraine\nVenezuela\nYemen\nEligibility Requirements\nTo be eligible for TPS, you must:\nBe a national of a country designated for TPS, or a person without nationality who last habitually resided in the designated country;\nFile during the open initial registration or re-registration period, or you meet the requirements for late initial filing during any extension of your country’s TPS designation (Late initial filers see ‘Filing Late’ section below);\nHave been continuously physically present (CPP) in the United States since the effective date of the most recent designation date of your country; and\nHave been continuously residing (CR) in the United States since the date specified for your country. (See your country’s TPS web page to the left). The law allows an exception to the continuous physical presence and continuous residence requirements for brief, casual and innocent departures from the United States. When you apply or re-register for TPS, you must inform USCIS of all absences from the United States since the CPP and CR dates. USCIS will determine whether the exception applies in your case.\nYou may\nNOT\nbe eligible for TPS or to maintain your existing TPS if you:\nHave been convicted of any felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the United States;\nAre found inadmissible as an immigrant under applicable grounds in INA section 212(a), including non-waivable criminal and security-related grounds;\nAre subject to any of the mandatory bars to asylum. These include, but are not limited to, participating in the persecution of another individual or engaging in or inciting terrorist activity;\nFail to meet the continuous physical presence and continuous residence in the United States requirements;\nFail to meet initial or late initial TPS registration requirements; or\nIf granted TPS, you fail to re-register for TPS, as required, without good cause.\nWhat to File\nYou must include the necessary forms, evidence, fees, or fee waiver request when filing your TPS application. Below is information about what you must include in your TPS package. Please also check your country’s specific TPS page to the left to see if there are any special filing instructions specific to your TPS-designated country.\nForms\nTo register or re-register for TPS you must file\nForm I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status\n. Eligible nationals of certain countries, or individuals without nationality who last habitually resided in those countries, can now file Form I-821 online. All applicants eligible to file for TPS under one of the current designations may file Form I-821 online.\nWhen filing an initial TPS application or re-registering for TPS, you can also request an employment authorization document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765, Request for Employment Authorization, at the time of filing Form I-821. You may also file your Form I-765 request separately at a later date. Filing Form I-821 with Form I-765 may help you receive your EAD more promptly if you are eligible. You may also file Form I-765 online if filing concurrently with Form I-821 online.\nWhen you apply, if you are aware that a relevant ground of inadmissibility applies to you and you need a waiver to obtain TPS, please include a\nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility\n, with your TPS application package. However, you do not need to file a new Form I-601 for an incident that USCIS has already waived with a prior TPS application. USCIS may grant a waiver of certain inadmissibility grounds for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is in the public interest.\nThese forms are free and available on the forms section of the USCIS website at:\nwww.uscis.gov/forms\n.\nEvidence\nWhen filing an initial TPS application, you must submit:\nIdentity and Nationality Evidence\n: to demonstrate your identity and that you are a national of a country designated for TPS (or that you have no nationality and you last habitually resided in a country designated for TPS).\nDate of Entry Evidence\n: to demonstrate when you entered the United States.\nContinuous Residence (CR) Evidence\n: to demonstrate that you have been in the United States since the CR date specified for your country (see your country’s TPS web page to the left).\nAny document that is not in English must be accompanied by a complete English translation. The translator must certify that:\nHe or she is competent both in English and the foreign language used in the original document; and\nThe translation is true and correct to the best of his or her ability, knowledge, and belief.\nIdentity and Nationality Evidence\nWe encourage you to submit primary evidence (see below), if available. If USCIS does not find  the document(s) you submit with your application to be sufficient, we will send you a request for additional evidence. If you cannot submit primary evidence of your identity and nationality, you may submit the secondary evidence listed below with your application.\nThe following table explains the different types of evidence you can provide.\nPrimary Evidence\nA copy of your passport;\nA copy of your birth certificate, accompanied by photo identification;  and/or\nAny national identity document bearing your photograph and/or fingerprint  issued by your country, including documents issued by your country’s Embassy or Consulate in the United States, such as a national ID card or naturalization certificate.\nNo Primary Evidence\nIf you do not have any of the primary evidence listed above, you must submit an affidavit with:\nProof of your unsuccessful efforts to obtain such documents; and\nAn explanation why the consular process for your country was unavailable to you, and affirming that you are a national of your country.\nUSCIS may interview you regarding your identity and nationality, and you may also submit additional evidence of your nationality and identity then, if available.\nSecondary Evidence\nNationality documentation, such as a naturalization certificate, even if it does not have your photograph and fingerprint;\nYour baptismal certificate if it indicates your nationality or a parent’s nationality;\nCopies of your school or medical records if they have information supporting your claim that you are a national from a country designated for TPS;\nCopies of other immigration documents showing your nationality and identity; or\nAffidavits from friends or family members who have close personal knowledge of the date and place of your birth and your parents' nationality. The person making the affidavit should include information about how he or she knows you or is related to you, and how he or she knows the details of the date and place of your birth and the nationality of your parents. The nationality of your parents is important if you are from a country where nationality is derived from a parent.\nYou may also provide any other document or information that you believe helps prove your nationality.\nPLEASE NOTE: Birth in a TPS-designated country does not always mean you are a national of that country. Please see your TPS-designated country’s nationality laws for further information.\nDate of Entry Evidence\nA copy of your passport;\nI-94 Arrival/Departure Record; or\nCopies of documents specified in the “Continuous Residence (CR) Evidence” section below.\nContinuous Residence (CR) Evidence\nEmployment records;\nRent receipts, utility bills, receipts or letters from companies;\nSchool records from the schools that you or your children have attended in the U.S.;\nHospital or medical records concerning treatment or hospitalization of you or your children; or\nAttestations by church, union or other organization officials who know you and where you have been residing.\nPlease see\nForm I-821 instructions\nfor more details on acceptable evidence.\nFees\nThere is a fee for Form I-821 if you are registering for TPS for the first time. There is no fee for Form I-821 if you are re-registering for TPS.\nOther related fees for initial registrations and re-registrations vary depending on:\nIf you want an EAD; and\nIf you need to request a waiver of grounds of inadmissibility.\nPlease review the\nForm I-821 webpage\ncarefully before applying, including the\nform instructions  (PDF, 325.6 KB)\nand the Fee section. This section explain what fees to pay and your payment options. Refer to the chart under Special Instructions for fee information. If you do not pay the appropriate fees (or submit a proper fee waiver request), we will reject your application. You can also find the filing fees for TPS-related forms on our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nNote:\nOn July 18, 2025, USCIS\nannounced\nnew fees required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill. For information about fees, please visit our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nFee Waiver\nIf you cannot afford the costs associated with the TPS filing, please make sure to include a fee waiver request on\nForm I-912, Application for Fee Waiver\n(or other written request). For more information about filing a fee waiver request, visit the webpages on\nForm I-912\nand on\nAdditional Information on Filing a Fee Waiver\n.\nIf you are filing an initial application and USCIS denies your fee waiver request, you may re-file and pay the correct fees either before the registration deadline\nor\nwithin 45 days of the date on the fee waiver denial notice, whichever is later.\nIf you are filing a re-registration application and USCIS denies your fee waiver request on or before the re-registration deadline, we recommend that you re-file and pay the correct fees before the re-registration deadline. If you are unable to file before the re-registration deadline, you may still re-file after the deadline and this will be reviewed under good cause for late re-registration.\nNote:\nOn July 18, 2025, USCIS\nannounced\nnew fees required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill. For information about fees, please visit our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nWhen and Where to File\nFor information about when and where you must file your TPS application, please see the country specific pages to the left.\nApplication Process\nStep 1: File Your Application\nOnce you have prepared your TPS package with the forms, evidence and filing fees (or request for a fee waiver), you will need to send it to the address indicated on your TPS country page to the left. Please make sure you\nsign your application\nand include the\ncorrect fee\namount (or fee waiver request). These are the two of the most common mistakes USCIS receives on TPS applications.  Please look above at the fee chart to see what fees you must pay (a properly documented fee waiver request may be submitted). If you do not pay the proper fees (or submit a proper fee waiver request), your application will be rejected.\nStep 2: USCIS Receives Your Application\nWhen USCIS receives your application, we will review it for completeness and for the proper fees or a properly documented fee waiver request. If your case meets the basic acceptance criteria, your application will be entered into our system and we will send you a receipt notice. At the top of this notice you will find a receipt number which can be used to check the\nstatus of your case\nonline.\nIf you do not receive your receipt notice within three weeks of filing, you can call the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283 to request assistance. If your application is rejected at the initial review stage, you may re-file within the registration period after correcting the problems described in the USCIS notification.\nIf your application was rejected because we determined you were not eligible for a fee waiver, you may submit a new TPS package. Go to the ‘Fee Waiver’ section above for more information.\nStep 3: USCIS Contacts You\nIf USCIS needs to collect your photograph, signature, and/or fingerprints (these are called biometrics), USCIS will send you an appointment notice to have your biometrics captured at an Application Support Center (\nASC\n). Every TPS applicant over 14 years old must have their biometrics collected. Biometrics are required for identity verification, background checks and the production of an EAD, if one has been requested.\nIn certain situations, such as when it’s impossible to take a fingerprint, USCIS can waive the collection of biometrics. In some cases, we may be able to reuse the biometrics previously collected in association with your previous TPS application. Even if you do not need to attend an ASC appointment, you still need to pay the biometrics fee (if required) to help cover costs associated with reusing your biometrics.\nStep 4: Go to the ASC\nWhen you report to an ASC, you must bring:\nEvidence of nationality and identity with a photograph of you, such as a passport\nYour receipt notice\nYour ASC appointment notice\nYour current EAD, if you already have one\nIf you cannot make your scheduled appointment, you may reschedule. To reschedule an ASC appointment, make a copy of your appointment notice to retain for your records, then mail the original notice with your rescheduling request to the ASC address listed on the notice. You should submit your request for rescheduling as soon as you know you have an unavoidable conflict on your scheduled ASC date. A new appointment notice will be sent to you by mail. Please note that rescheduling a biometrics appointment may cause the adjudication of your application to be delayed.\nIf you need an accommodation due to a disability that affects your ability to go to the ASC, please go to the\nDisability Accommodations for the Public\nwebpage for more information.\nWARNING: If you fail to appear for your ASC appointment without rescheduling, or if you repeatedly miss scheduled ASC appointments, your TPS application could be denied for abandonment.\nIf there is an emergency need for you to travel abroad for humanitarian reasons, you may request expedited processing on your advance parole application (Form I-131) after you have appeared at an\nASC\nfor your biometrics appointment. Please see the travel section below for more information.\nStep 5: USCIS Determines Work Eligibility\nIf you are not seeking an employment authorization document (EAD), skip to Step 6.\nIf you are...\nThen...\nApplying for TPS for the first time and seeking an EAD\nUSCIS will review your case to determine whether you are eligible to work before we make a final decision on your TPS application. If you are found to be eligible upon initial review of your TPS application (prima facie eligible) you will receive an EAD.\nNote: If your application is denied and you choose to appeal to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) or request review of your application by an immigration judge, your EAD will be extended while you are waiting for a decision. If your EAD expires, to request an extension of your EAD, you must file a Form I-765 along with evidence of your appeal to the AAO or that you have requested an immigration judge to review your TPS application.\nRe-Registering for TPS and seeking an EAD\nYou will receive your new EAD when your entire TPS package is adjudicated.\nUSCIS makes every effort to avoid backlogs at this step, but we urge you to remember that USCIS may experience a higher volume of applications in the first few months of a registration period.\nStep 6: USCIS Adjudicates the Application\nDuring this phase, we may ask you for additional documents to establish your eligibility for TPS. If you receive a request for evidence (RFE) or a notice of intent to deny, it is extremely important that you respond immediately to avoid processing delays and possible denial for failure to timely respond. Upon completion of your case, USCIS will notify you if your request for TPS is granted or denied. If one of the waivable grounds of inadmissibility applies to you, USCIS will give you an opportunity to submit a\nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility\nif you did not include this with your TPS package. Please submit this form within the time frame specified in the USCIS notice, or your case will be denied.\nStep 7: USCIS Approves or Denies the Application\nIf your application for TPS is…\nThen…\nApproved and you filed an initial application\nUSCIS will send you an approval notice and an EAD, if you requested one and haven’t received it before this step.\nApproved and you filed a re-registration application\nUSCIS will send you an approval notice if you do not request an EAD.\nUSCIS will send you a new EAD if you do request one.\nDenied\nUSCIS will send you a letter indicating the reason for your denial and, if applicable, provide you with the opportunity to\nappeal the denial\n.\nMaintaining TPS\nOnce you are granted TPS, you must re-register during each re-registration period to maintain TPS benefits. This applies to all TPS beneficiaries, including those who were initially granted by USCIS, an Immigration Judge, or the BIA. Follow the instructions above to apply for re-registration.\nEmployment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\nIf you have and maintain TPS, you may receive an extension of your EAD:\nThrough publication of a Federal Register notice extending the TPS designation of your country, if the Federal Register notice also authorizes an extension of existing EADs (see your country’s TPS page to the left for details);\nThrough notification of extension, typically when USCIS sends you a Form I-797, Notice of Action; or\nThrough the automatic EAD extensions announced through temporary final rules in May 2022 and April 2024. For more information, including eligibility requirements and showing proof of identity, visit the\nAutomatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\npage.\nFor more information, please see the country-specific pages to the left.\nFiling Late\nLate Re-Registration for TPS\nUSCIS may accept a late re-registration application if you have good cause for filing after the end of the re-registration period of your country. You must submit a letter that explains your reason for filing late with your re-registration application.\nIf you file your TPS re-registration application late, processing may be delayed and can lead to gaps in your work authorization.\nLate Initial Filing for TPS\nYou can apply for TPS for the first time during an extension of your country’s TPS designation period. If you qualify to file your initial TPS application late, you must still independently meet all the TPS eligibility requirements listed in the Eligibility section above.\nTo qualify to file your initial TPS application late, you must meet at least one of the late initial filing conditions below:\nDuring either the initial registration period of your country’s designation or during any subsequent initial registration period if your country was re-designated you met one of the following conditions, and you register while the condition still exists or within a 60-day period immediately following the expiration or termination of such condition\nYou were a nonimmigrant, were granted voluntary departure status, or any relief from removal\nYou had an application for change of status, adjustment of status, asylum, voluntary departure, or any relief from removal which was pending or subject to further review or appeal\nYou were a parolee or had a pending request for re-parole\nYou are a spouse of an individual who is currently eligible for TPS\nOR\nDuring either the initial registration period of your country’s designation or during any subsequent initial registration period if your country was re-designated you were a child of an individual who is currently eligible for TPS. There is no time limitation on filing if you meet this condition. So if your parent is currently eligible for TPS and you were his or her child (unmarried and under 21 years old) at any time during a TPS initial registration period for your country, you may still be eligible for late initial filing even if you are now over 21 years old or married. You may file during an extension of your TPS designated country.\nPlease check your country-specific web page for the dates of the initial registration period or periods that apply for late initial filing.\nPLEASE NOTE: You cannot obtain TPS as a derivative because your parent or child has TPS.\nTravel\nIf you have TPS and wish to travel outside the United States, you must apply for travel authorization. If we approve your request, we will issue you a Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by an Alien to the United States, to serve as evidence of DHS’s prior consent to your travel outside the United States. If a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer determines that you are eligible, they will admit you into TPS upon your return. Note that if you were previously granted parole, this admission will render you ineligible for a new period of parole.\nIf we are still adjudicating your application for TPS, and you wish to travel outside the United States, you must apply for travel authorization. If we approve your request for travel authorization, we will issue you a Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, to serve as evidence of DHS’s prior consent to your travel outside the United States.\nTo apply for TPS travel authorization or advance parole, you must file\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n. If you are filing Form I-131 together with Form I-821, send your forms to the address listed for your country. (Click on “Temporary Protected Status” on the menu above left to find a list of countries designated for TPS. Then click on the name of your country.) If you are filing Form I-131 separately based on a pending or approved Form I-821, check the\nDirect Filing Addresses for Form I-131\npage.\nIf you have TPS and leave the United States without first obtaining TPS travel authorization, you may lose TPS and you may not be able to reenter the United States. If you have a pending TPS application and leave the United States without first obtaining advance parole, we may deny your application for TPS, and you may not be able to reenter the United States.\nIf we are still adjudicating your TPS application, you may miss important USCIS notices, such as Requests for Additional Evidence, while you are outside the United States. If you do not respond to these requests, we may deny your application.\nWe encourage you to read and understand the travel warning on Form I-131 before you request TPS travel authorization or advance parole. You may want to seek legal advice before you request TPS travel authorization or advance parole for travel.\nChange of Address\nIf your address changes after you file your application, you must notify USCIS immediately. For information about how to notify USCIS go to\nwww.uscis.gov/addresschange\n.\nTPS Granted by an Immigration Judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals\nStep 1:\nIf an Immigration Judge (IJ) or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) granted you TPS, you must provide USCIS with proof of the TPS grant (such as a final order from the IJ or final decision from the BIA) when you file for your first TPS benefit (such as an EAD, travel authorization, or with your first TPS re-registration application filed with USCIS). You should also submit a copy of the I-821 TPS application that the IJ or the BIA approved.\nStep 2:\nSee the table below for filing information based on the first TPS benefit you are requesting after an IJ or BIA granted you TPS.\nIf the first TPS benefit you are requesting is...\nThen you must...\nAnd...\nYour first EAD,\nFile Form I-765 only with required fee(s) or fee waiver request. You must also submit a cover sheet that states \"DO NOT REJECT - TPS GRANTED BY IJ/BIA.\"\nSend your Form I-765 to the mailing address on your country specific page to the left.\nTravel Authorization\nFile Form I-131 with required fee\nSend your Form I-131 to the mailing address noted on the Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-131 page.\nYour first re-registration\nNOTE: Even if you were granted TPS by an IJ or the BIA, you must re-register with USCIS during each future extension period for your country.\nFile Form I-821 and Form I-765 with required fee(s) or a fee waiver request. See re-registration instructions above.\nSend your TPS package to the mailing address on your country specific page to the left.\nYou can find the filing fees for Forms I-821, I-765 and I-131 by visiting our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nAppealing a Denial\nIf USCIS denies your application, you will be informed in the denial notice whether you have 30 days to appeal to the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). If you do not have the right to appeal because you were placed in removal proceedings when your TPS application was denied by USCIS, you can request that the immigration judge adjudicate your TPS application.\nYou may also choose to file a motion to reconsider with the Service Center that adjudicated your TPS application by submitting:\nForm I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion\nThe correct filing fee, see\nform instructions\n. Or\nForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiver\n(or written request) if you are unable to pay\nIf USCIS denies your TPS application, we recommend that you consult with an accredited legal representative to determine whether you should pursue an appeal or motion. If you have been placed in removal proceedings, you may request that the immigration judge adjudicate your TPS application. If an immigration judge denies your request for TPS, you may file an appeal with the BIA.\nCountries Previously Designated for TPS\nAfghanistan\nCameroon\nGuinea\nHonduras\nLiberia\nNicaragua\nNepal\nSierra Leone\nOther Immigration Options\nYou might be eligible for other immigration options listed on the\nExplore My Options\npage.\nTo apply for a lawful permanent status (Green Card), you must be eligible under one of the categories listed on the\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\npage. Once you find the category that may fit your situation, click on the link provided to get information on eligibility requirements, how to apply, and whether your family members can also apply with you.\nNote on Seeking Asylum\n: Being granted and maintaining TPS status until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application is considered an extraordinary circumstance for the purposes of the one year filing deadline. In other words, having TPS status “stops the clock” on the requirement to file for asylum within one year of arriving in the United States, if the one-year clock has not already expired. See 8 CFR 208.4(a)(5)(iv).\nAvoid Scams\nPlease be aware that some\nunauthorized practitioners\nmay try to take advantage of you by claiming they can file TPS forms. These same individuals may ask that you pay them to file such forms. We want to ensure that all potential TPS applicants know how to obtain legitimate, accurate legal advice and assistance. A list of accredited representatives and free or low-cost legal providers is available on the USCIS website on the\nfinding legal advice\nweb page.\nWe don’t want you to become a victim of an immigration scam. If you need legal advice on immigration matters, make sure the person helping you is authorized to give legal advice.

      "content": "Refugees\nUnder United States law, a refugee is someone who:\nIs located outside of the United States\nIs of special humanitarian concern to the United States\nDemonstrates that they were persecuted or fear persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group\nIs not firmly resettled in another country\nIs admissible to the United States\nA refugee does\nnot\ninclude anyone who ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\nFor the legal definition of refugee, see section\n101(a)(42) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\nThe Refugee Process\nYou must receive a referral to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for consideration as a refugee. For more information on the referral criteria, see the\nUSRAP Consultations and Worldwide Processing Priorities\npage.\nIf you receive a referral, you will receive help filling out your application and then be interviewed abroad by a USCIS officer who will determine whether you are eligible for refugee resettlement. For more information about eligibility, see our\nRefugee Eligibility Determination\npage.\nYour case may include your spouse, child (unmarried and under 21 years of age), and in some limited circumstances, other family members. You may include a same-sex spouse in your application provided that you and your spouse are legally married.  As a general matter, USCIS looks to the law of the place where the marriage took place when determining whether it is valid for immigration law purposes. Same-sex partners who are not married but who are qualified to access the U.S. Refugee Admissions under one of the three designated worldwide processing priorities may have their cases cross-referenced  so that they can be interviewed at the same time and, if approved by USCIS, resettled in the same geographic area in the United States.\nThere is no fee to apply for refugee status. The information you provide will not be shared with your home country.\nFor more information about USRAP and the referral process, see our\nUSRAP Consultations and Worldwide Processing Priorities page.\nComing to the United States\nIf you are approved as a refugee, you will receive a medical exam, a cultural orientation, help with your travel plans, and a loan for your travel to the United States. After you arrive, you will be eligible for medical and cash assistance. For more information on benefits available to refugees, please see the\nHealth and Human Services, Office of Refugee Resettlement\npage.\nBringing Your Family to the United States\nIf you are a refugee in the United States and want your family members who are abroad to join you, you may file\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition\n, for your spouse and unmarried children under 21. You must file within two years of your arrival to the United States unless there are humanitarian reasons to excuse this deadline. For more information about bringing your family to the United States, see our\nFamily of Refugees and Asylees\npage.\nYou may also be eligible to file an Affidavit of Relationship for your spouse, child (unmarried, under 21), or parents. The Affidavit of Relationship is the form used to reunite refugees and asylees with close relatives who are determined to be refugees but are outside the United States. The Affidavit of Relationship records information about family relationships and must be completed in order to begin the application process for relatives who may be eligible to enter the United States as refugees through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. For information on the current nationalities eligible to file, see\nU.S. Department of State, Bureau of Population, Refugees & Migration\n.\nWorking in the United States\nAs a refugee, you may legally work as soon as you arrive in the United States. When you are admitted to the United States, you will receive a Form I-94 containing a refugee admission stamp. We will also create a digital\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, for you if you have an approved Form I-590. After you are admitted to the United States, we will adjudicate your Form I-765. We will generally produce your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) within approximately 2 weeks after we approve your application. We will mail your EAD via U.S. Postal Service Priority Mail to your address of record.\nThe time frame for you to receive your EAD card may vary, depending on delivery times. While you wait for your EAD, you can present your Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, to your employer as proof you can legally work in the United States. If you were admitted to the United States as a following-to-join refugee beneficiary of an approved Form I-730, we will process your paper Form I-765 after we receive it.\nIf you do not receive your EAD card within 90 days of your admission into the United States as a refugee based on approved Form I-590, you may call the\nUSCIS Contact Center\n. When you call, indicate that you are calling about an auto EAD. You may also contact us by clicking on “Connect to Live Agent” in the Chat with Emma feature on our website. When you contact about your EAD, you must have your A-Number and Form I-765 receipt number available. You can find your Form I-765 receipt number on the Form I-765 receipt notice we mailed to your address of record.\nFiling for a Permanent Residency (Green Card)\nIf you are admitted as a refugee, you must apply for a Green Card one year after coming to the United States. To apply for permanent residency, file\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence\nor to\nAdjust Status\n. There is no fee for refugees to file the Form I-485. In addition, refugees do not have to pay for fingerprinting/biometrics fees.\nFor more information on obtaining a Green Card, see our\nGreen Card for Refugees\npage.\nTraveling Abroad\nIf you have refugee status and want to travel outside the United States, you will need to obtain a\nRefugee Travel Document\nin order to return to the United States. If you do not obtain a Refugee Travel Document in advance of departure, you may be unable to re-enter the United States. If you return to the country from which you fled, you will have to explain how you were able to return safely.\nRelated Links\nRefugee News\nRefugee News Releases\nRefugee Alerts\nUSCIS Welcomes Refugees and Asylees\nMore Information\nUSRAP Flowchart\nUSRAP Consultation and Worldwide Processing Priorities\nRefugee Eligibility Determination\nRefugee Processing Data\nRefugee Processing and Security Screening\nRequest for Review Tip Sheet\nQuestions and Answers: Refugees\nImmigration and Nationality Act\nUSCIS Welcomes Refugees and Asylees\nForms\nI-730, Refugees/Asylee Relative Petition\nI-485, Application to Register for Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\nI-765, Application for Employment Authorization\nOther USCIS Links\nGreen Card for a Refugee\nFamily of Refugees and Asylees\nExternal Links\nU.S. Department of State Report to Congress: Proposed Refugee Admissions Fiscal Year 2023\nU.S. Department of State: Refugee Admissions Statistics\nImproved Security Procedures for Refugees Entering the United States, Oct. 24, 2017\nFact Sheet on Renting to Refugees and Other Eligible Newcomers  (PDF)\nFAQs on Renting to Refugees and Other Eligible Newcomers  (PDF)\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n09/17/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Female Genital Mutilation or Cutting (FGM/C)\nFGM/C refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It may be called “female circumcision” in some parts of the world. The practice has no health benefits and can lead to a range of serious physical and mental health problems.\nThe U.S. Government’s View of FGM/C\nThe U.S. government opposes FGM/C, no matter the type, degree, or severity, and no matter what the motivation for performing it. The U.S. government considers FGM/C to be a human rights violation and a form of child abuse.\nIt is against the law\nto perform FGM/C in the United States on a child under the age of 18, or for the parent, caretaker, or guardian of a child under the age of 18 to facilitate or consent to FGM/C being performed . It is also against the law to send or attempt to send a child outside the United States so FGM/C can be performed. People who violate this law can face prison time and significant immigration consequences. Additionally, anyone in the United States who performs FGM/C on a person 18 years old or older without their consent may be charged with a crime under state law.\nFGM/C and U.S. Immigration Benefits\nIf someone performed FGM/C on you, that person violated U.S. law. You are\nnot\nat fault, and you may be a victim of a crime or persecution. You may be eligible for certain immigration benefits, such as:\nAsylum\n;\nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) classification\n; or\nU nonimmigrant status\n(also known as the U visa) for victims of certain qualifying crimes.\nYou should consult with a qualified attorney or accredited representative if you have questions about your immigration relief options. For more information on USCIS humanitarian programs and protection, visit our\nHumanitarian\nwebpage. To find authorized immigration service providers, visit our\nFind Legal Services\nwebpage.\nIf You Have Experienced or Are At Risk of FGM/C\nCall 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453) for available resources if:\nYou believe you are at risk of FGM/C;\nYou have undergone FGM/C;\nYou have questions about FGM/C;\nYou have information about someone who is performing FGM/C in the United States; or\nYou know of someone who may be at risk of FGM/C here or outside the United States.\nAdditional Information and Resources\nUSCIS is committed to ending FGM/C. Together with the White House and other U.S. government agencies, we are working in the United States and in other countries where  this practice occurs to educate communities about the damaging effects of FGM/C.\nTo learn more about FGM/C and what the U.S. government and international organizations are doing to help eliminate the practice, view these resources:\nU.S. Government\nStatement on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation\nU.S. Department of State: Observance of the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States: Updated Estimates of Women and Girls at Risk, 2012\nU.S. Department of Justice newsletter on the STOP FGM Act\nInternational Organizations\nThe United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Web page on FGM/C\nUnited Nations International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation\nUnited Nations Population Fund Web page on FGM/C\nPopulation Reference Bureau: Women and Girls at Risk of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in the United States\nWorld Health Organization Fact Sheet on Female Genital Mutilation\nOther Resources\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - Amharic\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - Arabic\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - French\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - Indonesian\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - Malay\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - Somali\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - Swahili\nUSCIS FGM/C brochure - Tigrinya\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n02/06/2024\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

The term “self-petitioner” refers to an individual who files\nForm I-131\nfor themselves.\nBeneficiary\n: A beneficiary is an individual residing outside the United States (or a person seeking re-parole, as explained below) who receives parole. If someone is self-petitioning, they are both the “petitioner” and the “beneficiary.”\nFinancial Supporter:\nA financial supporter is an individual who agrees to provide financial support for the beneficiary of a parole application by filing\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n.\nParolee\n: A parolee is an individual who is paroled into the United States. (A beneficiary of a parole application becomes a parolee when they are paroled into the United States at a port of entry.)\nWhat Is Parole?\nUSCIS uses its discretion to authorize parole. Parole allows an individual, who may be inadmissible or otherwise ineligible for admission into the United States, to be paroled into the United States for a temporary period. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows the secretary of homeland security to use their discretion to parole any alien applying for admission into the United States temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. (See INA section 212(d)(5).)\nAn individual who is paroled into the United States has not been formally admitted into the United States for purposes of immigration law.\nParole is not intended to be used solely to avoid normal visa processing procedures and timelines, to bypass inadmissibility waiver processing, or to replace established refugee processing channels.\nLength of Parole\nIf authorized, we will specify the duration of parole for a temporary period of time to accomplish the purpose of the parole. For example, if parole is requested to attend a civil court proceeding between private parties, we may authorize parole for the period of time necessary to attend the proceedings. We typically grant parole for no more than 1 year, although we may grant parole for a longer duration depending on the reason for the parole.\nParole ends on the date the parole period expires or when a parolee departs the United States or acquires an immigration status, whichever occurs first. In some cases, we may place conditions on parole, such as reporting requirements. We may revoke parole at any time and without notice if we determine that parole is no longer warranted or a parolee fails to comply with any conditions of parole.\nWork Permits\nWe may, at our discretion, grant a parolee temporary employment authorization, if it is not inconsistent with the purpose and duration of their parole. You may request employment authorization after being paroled into the United States by filing\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n.\nWho Can Apply for Parole?\nYou may request parole for yourself or for someone else by filing\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n. A petitioner is an individual or entity who is filing\nForm I-131\nfor someone else who is outside the United States. You may also request parole for yourself (self-petitioner) from outside the United States. A petitioner does not have to be a resident of the United States or related to the beneficiary.\nThe Need for a Financial Supporter\nAn important factor we consider in determining whether to authorize parole is whether the beneficiary will have a means of support while in the United States. We require evidence of an individual who agrees to financially support the beneficiary in the United States. Lack of evidence of financial support while in the United States is a strong negative factor that may lead us to deny parole. We will take into account the\nHealth and Human Services Federal poverty guidelines\n, along with any special circumstances related to the beneficiary’s need for care, when we assess whether there are sufficient funds in place to adequately support the beneficiary when they are in the United States.\nRequirements for Financial Supporters\nThe financial supporter is the individual who agrees to provide financial support to the beneficiary while they are in the United States for the duration of the parole authorization period. The financial supporter may or may not be the same person or entity as the petitioner. The financial supporter must submit a\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n, for each parole request to establish whether they have enough financial resources to support the beneficiary during their stay in the United States, and if the funds are overseas, access to those funds for the beneficiary’s stay in the United States.\nThough there is no requirement regarding the financial supporter’s immigration status in the United States, a financial supporter who has a more permanent status in the United States, such as a lawful permanent resident or a U.S. citizen, may more readily be able to establish their ability to support the beneficiary in the United States. Evidence of the financial supporter’s immigration status or citizenship in the United States may be relevant to their ability to support the beneficiary. A petitioner should generally include evidence of their financial supporter’s immigration status or citizenship in the United States, such as the financial supporter’s Permanent Resident Card (Green Card), naturalization certificate, birth certificate, or passport with the parole request.\nIt is important to read the\nForm I-134 instructions\ncarefully for information about what kind of evidence is required to demonstrate sufficient income and financial resources.  Some examples of evidence that is helpful in demonstrating financial resources include pay stubs, last filed tax return, or a letter from a financial supporter’s employer.\nMultiple Financial Supporters\nWhen a petitioner is seeking a financial supporter, they must take into account the Health and Human Services Federal\npoverty guidelines\nand any special needs of the beneficiary. If the petitioner is unable to find a financial supporter who alone has sufficient means to support the beneficiary in the United States, the petitioner may indicate more than 1 financial supporter, if they have the means and agree to support the beneficiary while paroled in the United States. In this situation, the petitioner must submit a\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n, along with the proper supporting documentation, from each financial supporter.\nSelf-Financial Supporter\nA beneficiary may also demonstrate that they are financially self-sufficient by submitting a\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n, with supporting financial documentation.\nOrganization as a Financial Supporter\nOccasionally, a nonprofit organization or medical institution may serve as a financial supporter on a parole application. In those instances, if an employee of the organization cannot complete a\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n, the petitioner should include with their parole application a letter from the organization committing to financially support the beneficiary.\nEligibility for Parole\nA USCIS officer considers each request and the evidence provided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all of the circumstances. (See Section 212(d)(5) of the INA.) The burden of proof is on the petitioner to establish that we should authorize parole. We will authorize parole only if we conclude, based on all the evidence the petitioner submits and any other relevant evidence available to us, that:\nThere are urgent humanitarian or significant public benefit reasons for the beneficiary to be in the United States; and\nThe beneficiary merits a favorable exercise of discretion.\nUrgent Humanitarian Reasons\nThere is no statutory or regulatory definition of \"urgent humanitarian reasons.\" USCIS officers look at all of the circumstances, taking into account factors such as (but not limited to):\nWhether or not the circumstances are pressing;\nThe effect of the circumstances on the individual’s welfare and well-being; and\nThe degree of suffering that may result if parole is not authorized.\nAn applicant may demonstrate urgency by establishing a reason to be in the United States that calls for immediate or other time-sensitive action, including (but not limited to) critical medical treatment, or the need to visit, assist or support a family member who is at an end-of-life stage of an illness or disease.\nThe factors considered in determining urgent humanitarian reasons depend on the type of parole request. See\nGuidance for Certain Types of Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole Requests\nfor more information on factors often considered in some of the more common types of requests.\nSignificant Public Benefit\nThere is no statutory or regulatory definition of “significant public benefit.” Parole based on significant public benefit includes, but is not limited to, law enforcement and national security reasons or foreign or domestic policy considerations. USCIS officers look at all of the circumstances presented in the case.\nWhile the beneficiary may personally benefit from the authorization of parole, the statutory standard focuses on the public benefit in extending parole. For example, a beneficiary’s participation in legal proceedings may be a significant public benefit, because the opportunity for all relevant parties to participate in legal proceedings may be required for justice to be served.\nThere may be circumstances where a request is based on both urgent humanitarian reasons and significant public benefit reasons. For example, we may authorize parole if a person requests it to obtain medical care that involves experimental treatment or medical trials from which a larger community in the United States may benefit.\nDetermining Who Is Authorized Parole\nWe exercise our discretion on a case-by-case basis, by evaluating positive factors in the record against any negative factors. Having an urgent humanitarian reason or a significant public benefit is a positive determining factor, and it is evaluated against any negative factors present in a case. We evaluate the complete record.\nSome common discretionary factors that we evaluate include (but are not limited to):\nWhether the purpose of the parole request may be accomplished within a specific, temporary period of time;\nWhether the beneficiary intends to leave the United States when their parole expires or has means to obtain lawful immigration status during the parole authorization period or any re-parole period that is envisioned (where applicable);\nWhether there is evidence of any national security concerns;\nWhether there is evidence of any criminal history or previous immigration violations;\nWhether there is evidence of any previous participation in fraud;\nWhether the beneficiary’s presence would benefit a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident or community in the United States;\nWhether the beneficiary will have sufficient financial support while in the United States;\nEvidence of the beneficiary’s character;\nThe effect of the beneficiary’s presence on a community in the United States; and\nWhether there are other means, other than parole, that are available to the beneficiary so they can travel to and remain in the United States for the stated parole purpose, such as the ability or inability to obtain a visa.\nNo single factor will determine the outcome of the case. Each decision is based on all of the circumstances present in a case.\nWe may revoke parole at any time if we determine that parole is no longer necessary or the parolee fails to comply with any conditions on the parole.\nParole Process\nThis is an overview of the parole process:\nStep 1: Filing a Parole Request\nThe petitioner reads the instructions for\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, and\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n. Then, the petitioner files their application to the\ncorrect address\nor online if they are\neligible\nand not requesting a fee waiver:\nForm I-131, Application for Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n(completed and signed);\nForm I-134\n(completed and signed);\nAll required evidence and supporting documentation (see\nGuidance on Evidence for Certain Types of Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole Requests\n); and\nThe filing fee (or\nForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiver\n, or a written request for a fee waiver), unless you are not required to pay a filing fee. Find fee information on the\nFee Schedule\n.\nTo receive an email or text message when we accept your form, complete\nForm G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance\n, and clip it to the front of the application.\n(See the Requesting Parole section below for more specific information.)\nIf you file your parole request properly with the appropriate fee (or request for fee waiver), the Lockbox will send you a receipt notice confirming that we have received your forms and will send the parole request to the USCIS International and Refugee Affairs Division (USCIS-IRAD) in Washington, D.C., for adjudication.\nAfter we receive your Form I-131 and Form I-134, you will receive a:\nBiometric services appointment notice, if applicable;\nNotice to appear for an interview, if required; and\nNotice of our decision.\nDo you want to check for status updates, provide additional evidence, or see notices related to your case? Learn how to create a\nUSCIS online account\nto stay informed.\nStep 2: USCIS Reviews the Request for Jurisdiction and Urgency (Triage)\nWe initially review requests for parole to confirm jurisdiction and, if we have jurisdiction, to determine whether there is a particularly urgent or time-sensitive reason for expedited processing. If the request is not within our jurisdiction, we will transfer it to the office with jurisdiction over the request.\nStep 3: USCIS Officer Makes a Decision\nA USCIS officer considers the request. This includes:\nReviewing the request and all supporting documents;\nConducting all mandatory security checks and vetting;\nIssuing a Request for Evidence (RFE) or Notice of Intent to Deny, if necessary;\nDocumenting the basis for the decision; and\nPreparing the decision notice(s).\nStep 4: Supervisor or Designated Officer Reviews the Decision\nA supervisor or designated officer reviews all parole decisions before we finalize any decision.\nStep 5: USCIS Provides Notification of the Decision\nIf the beneficiary initially appears eligible for parole:\nWe will mail a conditional approval notice or a notice of continued parole processing to the petitioner and any representative of record. The conditional approval notice or notice of continued parole processing provides information regarding next steps for the parole request, such as scheduling an appointment with the U.S. embassy, biometrics collection, obtaining travel documents, and any conditions the beneficiary must comply with if paroled into the United States. If the beneficiary is in a country with a U.S. embassy or consulate, we will also notify the U.S. embassy or consulate closest to the beneficiary’s residence of our decision. If the beneficiary is not in a country with a U.S. embassy or consulate, the petitioner must notify us once the beneficiary travels to a location with a U.S. embassy or consulate before we can continue processing the parole request.\nIf denied:\nWe will mail a denial letter to the petitioner and any representative of record.\nStep 6: Issuance of Travel Documents (Conditional Approvals Only)\nIf USCIS conditionally approves a request, the conditional approval notice will inform the petitioner that the beneficiary must complete a\nForm DS-160, Application for a Nonimmigrant Visa\n, and appear for an appointment with the Department of State consular section at a U.S. embassy or consulate to verify their identity and collect biometrics for additional security vetting. All beneficiaries 14 years and older must provide biometrics. If no derogatory (negative) information or new identity information is found during vetting, the consular section issues a document referred to as a boarding foil that allows the beneficiary to travel to the United States within 30 days of it being issued. Issuance of a boarding foil does not guarantee parole, but it allows the beneficiary to proceed to Step 7 below.\nNote: Those who receive a notice of continued parole processing because the beneficiary is in a location without a U.S. embassy or consulate must notify USCIS when the beneficiary is in a location with a U.S. embassy or consulate where they can complete the required steps above. At that time, USCIS will communicate with the petitioner about next steps in the process.\nStep 7: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Paroles the Beneficiary into the United States (Conditional Approvals Only)\nA CBP officer inspects the beneficiary at the port of entry. If CBP authorizes parole for the beneficiary, CBP will issue the parolee a\nForm I-94, Arrival/Departure Record\n, documenting the length of their parole period. The parole period begins when CBP paroles the beneficiary at the port of entry. After arriving in the United States, the parolee may request employment authorization by filing\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n.\nIf a parolee fails to comply with any of the conditions of parole listed in the conditional approval notice or notice regarding conditions of parole, we may terminate their parole. See 8 USC 1182(d)(5)(A) and 8 CFR 212.5(c);(d).\nHow to Apply\nTo request parole, you must:\nComplete\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, and, for each parole beneficiary, include the filing fee or\nForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiver\n, or a written request for fee waiver.\nThe Form I-131 may be filed online for an  Initial parole document for aliens who are currently outside the United States but are not applying under a specific parole program or process. This includes individuals applying on behalf of someone else who is outside the United States for the first time (initial application), but not under a specific parole program or process.  (Part 1. Box 7. on Form I-131). Do not file online if you are requesting a fee waiver.\nNOTE: To file Form I-131 online, you\nmust\nvisit\nmy.uscis.gov\nto sign into your USCIS online account or create a new one. There is no cost to create an online account, which offers a variety of features, including the ability to receive case status updates, access all notices, and upload additional evidence.\nAlternatively, you may submit Form I-131 on paper by mail, following the\nForm I-131 filing instructions\n.\nComplete a\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n, for each beneficiary to show how each beneficiary will be financially supported in the United States.\nIf there is more than 1 financial supporter, each financial supporter must submit a\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n.\nInclude a detailed explanation, as well as supporting documentation, of the reasons you are requesting parole for the beneficiary. (See the Submitting Evidence section below for more specific information, along with the\nGuidance on Evidence for Certain Types of Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole Requests\npage.)\nIf you are represented, you must include a completed\nForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Representative\n, for USCIS to communicate with your attorney or representative.\nTo receive an email or text message when we accept your form, complete\nForm G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance\n, and attach it to the front of the application.\nSubmitting Evidence\nThe petitioner must show, through the parole request and supporting evidence, that the beneficiary qualifies for parole and merits a favorable exercise of discretion. Avoid processing delays by submitting all relevant supporting evidence. A USCIS officer may issue a Request for Evidence to seek additional information. In addition to the\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n,\nForm I-134, Declaration of Financial Support\n, and the filing fee or request for fee waiver, you should submit the following evidence to support a parole request:\nDetailed explanation of the reasons why you are requesting parole;\nDetailed explanation of the length of time the beneficiary will need parole;\nDetailed explanation of why the beneficiary cannot obtain a U.S. nonimmigrant or immigrant visa from the U.S. Department of State, including:\nWhen and where the beneficiary attempted to obtain a visa, if applicable;\nIf a visa application was denied, a copy of the denial letter; and\nIf applicable, a detailed explanation of the reasons why the beneficiary cannot obtain any required waiver of inadmissibility and a copy of any denial letter received;\nCopies of any previously filed immigrant petitions (Form I-130, Form I-140, Form I-360, etc.) or nonimmigrant petitions filed by or for the beneficiary, if available;\nCopies of any documents that support the request, including a clear and legible copy of a government-issued identification that indicates the beneficiary’s citizenship.\nIf you provide a birth certificate, please submit a copy of the front and back of the original birth certificate; and\nCopies of a U.S. passport, Permanent Resident Card (Green Card), birth certificate or other evidence of valid U.S. immigration status or citizenship for the petitioner and financial supporter, where applicable.\nAny foreign language document must be accompanied by a full English language translation and a certification signed by the translator indicating that the translator is competent to translate the document and that the translation is true and accurate to the best of the translator's abilities.\nSee\nGuidance for Certain Types of Humanitarian or Significant Public Benefit Parole Requests\nfor information on what additional evidence may support specific types of parole requests.\nWhere to File\nPlease check our\nDirect Filing Addresses for Form I-131\npage for information on where to mail your application. If you do not submit your application to the appropriate direct filing address, it may delay our processing.\nPlease see the\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, webpage for additional instructions on submitting requests by mail or online.\nLength of Parole Consideration Process\nWe are currently receiving an extremely high number of requests for parole. While we try to process all requests for parole quickly and efficiently, petitioners should expect processing delays. It will take time for us to work through the unprecedented number of parole requests we have received since Fall 2021 and return to normal processing times. We are taking the necessary steps to return to target processing times as soon as possible. If we need to ask you for additional information, it will take us longer to process your request.\nTo avoid processing delays,\nit is critical that you include all relevant supporting evidence when you apply and in response to a Request For Evidence (RFE), if you receive an RFE.\nExpedited Processing\nAs mentioned above, we review all requests to determine urgency on a case-by-case basis, even if you do not request expedited processing. USCIS has sole discretion to decide whether to accommodate an expedite request. If we determine expedited processing is appropriate, we will prioritize adjudicating your request. We do not routinely provide individual responses to petitioners or their representatives of record of the decision to expedite.\nTo facilitate our review, you may specifically request expedited processing by doing the following:\nFollow the\nForm I-131 instructions\n;\nWrite the word EXPEDITE in black ink in the top right corner of the application when filing a paper Form I-131 or, when filing online, complete the expedited processing written statement;\nProvide your (or your representative’s) email address, phone number, and fax number with any expedite request; and\nInclude a detailed explanation of the reason for the expedite request, along with any available supporting evidence.\nGenerally, most requests received for parole are based on urgent humanitarian needs. Therefore, you must demonstrate that your parole request is particularly urgent or time-sensitive, such as a life-threatening or other extremely urgent situation, to receive expedited processing.\nIf the beneficiary’s circumstances have changed since the parole request was initially filed and there is an urgent need for expedited processing, the petitioner or representative of record may submit an expedite request, along with any supporting evidence in your\nUSCIS online account\nby selecting “Unsolicited Evidence.” Please note that if you filed your parole request by paper, then you will need an “Online Access Code” to link your paper request to your USCIS online account. You may also mail or email evidence to our office. Please see the mailing and email address listed on your Receipt of Request for Parole notice. Please include “expedite request” and the receipt number in the subject line of the email. You will receive an automated response to your email inquiry, and you should review this response carefully. We recommend providing evidence in your USCIS online account as it may take us longer to process evidence that is mailed or emailed to our office.\nWe are currently receiving an extremely high number of requests for parole. While we try to process all urgent requests for parole quickly and efficiently, petitioners should expect processing delays. It will take time for us to work through the unprecedented number of parole requests we have received since Fall 2021 and return to normal processing times. We are taking the necessary steps to return to target processing times as soon as possible.\nIf you do not submit required evidence at the time of filing your parole request, or if we need to ask you for additional information, it will take us longer to process your request.\nIf Parole Is Denied\nIf we deny your parole request, and you believe we incorrectly decided your case, you may file a motion requesting we reconsider the decision, reopen the proceeding, or both.\nThe requirements for motions are listed at\n8 C.F.R. § 103.5\n. File a motion with\nForm I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion\n. You must file it within 33 days of the date on the denial notice and include the correct fee amount or a request for a fee waiver. This 33-day time period includes 3 days added for service by mail. The\nForm I-290B webpage\nhas the latest information on  filing location and other requirements. For information on the filing fee and eligibility to request a fee waiver, see the\nFee Schedule\n. If you file Form I-290B, include a copy of your denial notice.\nAlternatively, if there are significant new facts that are relevant to the application for parole, you may consider filing a new\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, with a fee or a request for fee waiver (Form I-912). There is no limit to the number of Forms I-131 a person may file.\nTravel for Parolees\nLeaving the United States\nA parole document provided to an individual outside the United States is valid to be presented only 1 time for parole at the port of entry. If the individual leaves the United States, their parole will end when they depart. If the parolee wishes to travel abroad and then return to the United States as a parolee, they may file a separate application on a new Form I-131 for advance parole before traveling abroad. For information on how to apply for advance parole while in the United States, please see\nForm I-131 instructions\n. The individual may also apply for a visa or again request parole from outside of the United States in order to return.\nRe-Parole\nParole ends when the parole period expires, the parolee leaves the United States or is admitted in a lawful immigration status, or if DHS decides to terminate parole. Although parole is temporary in nature, in some instances, an individual may need to remain in the United States beyond the period of authorized parole. In such instances, an individual may request a new period of parole, also known as re-parole, from within the United States.\nRequest re-parole by:\nFiling a new\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n;\nCheck the correct box under application type 10 or type 11, in Part 1 of the form, and enter the “Admit Until Date” or “Parole Until Date” as it appears on your Form I-94 in Part 1, question 12.\nIncluding required fees (or request for fee waiver (Form I-912)); and\nSubmitting materials and evidence to support your request for re-parole, including an explanation and providing supporting documents on the need for an additional parole period.\nThe Form I-131 may be filed online for re-parole for:\nArrival/departure records for re-parole for aliens who are requesting a new period of parole (from inside the United States), also known as re-parole, under the following programs or processes:\nCertain Afghans Paroled into the United States After July 31, 2021 (Part 1. Box 10 B. on Form I-131)\nCertain Ukrainians Paroled into the United States After Feb. 24, 2022 (Part 1. Box 10. C on Form I-131)\nFilipino World War II Veterans Parole Program (Part 1. Box 10.

      "content": "Forced Marriage\nNote: This material is intended to help you understand the dynamics of forced marriage generally and does not provide legal definitions or advice.\nForced marriage means a marriage with 1 or more elements of force, fraud, or coercion, and where 1 or both parties do not or cannot consent to the marriage. Consent means that you have given your full, free, and informed agreement to marry your intended spouse and to the timing of the marriage. Forced marriage may occur when family members or others use physical or emotional abuse, threats, or deception to force you to marry without your consent. Forced marriage can be both a cause and a consequence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.\nForced marriage can happen to individuals of any race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sex, age, immigration status, or national origin. It can happen to individuals from any economic or educational background.\nSome Signs That May Accompany a Forced Marriage\nYou feel you do not or did not have a choice regarding whom to marry or when to marry.\nYou are experiencing or being threatened with abandonment, isolation, or physical or emotional abuse if you do not marry or if you attempt to leave a marriage you did not consent to.\nYou are afraid of the consequences of saying “no” to a marriage, including suffering physical harm or being cut off from your family.\nYou are being closely monitored in an effort to prevent you from talking to others about the pressure you are facing.\nYou feel you cannot refuse to marry or leave a marriage you did not consent to because it would shame or harm you or your family.\nYou believe that you or people you care about would be hurt or even killed if you refuse to marry or attempt to leave a marriage you did not consent to.\nYou have had your travel documents, identification, communication devices, or money taken away from you and will not get them back unless you agree to marry or remain in a marriage you did not consent to.\nThe Difference between Forced Marriage and Arranged Marriage\nArranged marriage is a common practice in many cultures and is\nnot the same\nas forced marriage. In an arranged marriage, families may play a role in choosing the marriage partner, but both individuals are free to choose whether or not to marry and when to get married. A forced marriage happens when families or others not only arrange the marriage but\nalso\ndeny the individuals to be married the ultimate choice of whether, when, and whom to marry.\nThe Difference Between Forced Marriage and Human Trafficking\nUnder federal law, human trafficking involves exploiting someone to compel a commercial sex act or forced labor. Generally, this exploitation must involve force, fraud or coercion to be considered human trafficking. (However, if someone under 18 years old is induced to perform a commercial sex act, that is considered human trafficking even if there is no force, fraud or coercion.) Forced marriage and human trafficking are distinct forms of abuse. While both forced marriage and human trafficking are forms of abuse that exploit the victim, not all forced marriages involve human trafficking.\nThe U.S. Government’s View of Forced Marriage\nThe U.S. government is opposed to forced marriage and considers it to be a serious human rights abuse. If the victim of forced marriage is a child, forced marriage is also a form of child abuse.\nThe U.S. government is working in the United States and abroad to end the practice and to assist individuals who have been forced into marriage or are at risk of being forced into marriage.\nIn some U.S. states, forced marriage is a crime, and in all U.S. states, people who force someone to marry may be charged with violating state laws, including those against domestic violence, child abuse, rape, assault, kidnapping, threats of violence, stalking, or coercion. People who force someone to marry may also face significant immigration consequences, such as being inadmissible to or removable from the United States.\nIf you have been or are being forced into marriage,\nyou are not at fault and you have not violated any U.S. laws\nby entering into the marriage.\nIf You Are In or At Risk of a Forced Marriage\nIf you believe you are in a forced marriage or are at risk of a forced marriage, you may be able to receive legal aid, social services, and safety planning (including emergency housing). You may also be able to obtain an order of protection, annulment, legal separation, divorce, or a child custody order granting you custody of any children resulting from the forced marriage.\nIf You Are in the United States\nIf you need help to prevent or leave a forced marriage or want more information about options and support for you or others facing a forced marriage in the United States or abroad, see the chart below for resources:\nYour situation\nWho to contact\nIf you are in immediate danger\nCall 911\nto receive emergency help from your local police.\nIf you need confidential help at any time of day or night\nThese hotlines are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week:\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline\n: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline\n: 1-888-373-7888\nDisclaimer: The organizations listed above are not affiliated with USCIS.\nIf You Are Outside the United States\nIf you are a U.S. citizen outside of the United States and are being forced into a marriage, please contact the\nnearest U.S. Embassy or consulate\nfor assistance.\nForced Marriage and U.S. Immigration Benefits\nIf you are a U.S. citizen being forced to sponsor your spouse or fiancé(e), or a lawful permanent resident being forced to sponsor a spouse for an immigration benefit, you may withdraw your petition at any time before a decision is issued by USCIS or, if approved, before the person is admitted or granted adjustment of status.\nWithdrawing your petition may trigger certain automatic notifications that USCIS mails to the address on file. This means that your spouse or fiancé(e) may receive a notice from USCIS that you have withdrawn your petition. Therefore, before withdrawing your petition, you may want to talk with an organization or immigration lawyer or accredited representative familiar with forced marriage situations to discuss your options and plan for your safety. To find authorized immigration service providers, visit the\nFind Legal Services\npage.\nIf you are an alien who has been forced into a marriage or who fears you may be forced to marry, you may be eligible for immigration relief in the United States, such as:\nAsylum;\nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) classification\n;\nSelf-petition under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)\n;\nA waiver of the joint filing requirement based on battery or extreme cruelty for family-based conditional permanent residents;\nT nonimmigrant status\n(also known as the T visa) for victims of human trafficking; or\nU nonimmigrant status\n(also known as the U visa) for victims of certain qualifying crimes.\nTo find authorized immigration service providers, visit the\nFind Legal Services\npage.\nAdditional Information and Resources\nForced Marriage Information:\nU.S. Department of State\nand\nUnited States Agency for International Development\nHuman Trafficking Information:\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security Blue Campaign\nResources for Victims of Human Trafficking & Other Crimes\nQuestions and Answers: Victims of Human Trafficking, T Nonimmigrant Status\nQuestions and Answers: Battered Spouses, Children and Parents Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Tip Line\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n01/25/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Victims of Criminal Activity: U Nonimmigrant Status\nThe U nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity. Congress created the U nonimmigrant visa with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (including the Battered Immigrant Women’s Protection Act) in October 2000. The legislation was intended to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of aliens and other crimes, while also protecting victims of crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse due to the crime and are willing to help law enforcement authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity. The legislation also helps law enforcement agencies to better serve victims of crimes.\nTo learn about updates to the program, visit our\nU Nonimmigrant Status Program Updates\npage.\nU Nonimmigrant Eligibility\nYou may be eligible for a U nonimmigrant visa if:\nYou are the victim of qualifying criminal activity.\nYou have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been a victim of criminal activity.\nYou have information about the criminal activity. If you are under the age of 16 or unable to provide information due to a disability, a parent, guardian, or next friend may possess the information about the crime on your behalf (see\nglossary\nfor definition of ‘next friend’).\nYou were helpful, are helpful, or are likely to be helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of the crime. If you are under the age of 16 or unable to provide information due to a disability, a parent, guardian, or next friend may assist law enforcement on your behalf.\nThe crime occurred in the United States or violated U.S. laws.\nYou are admissible to the United States. If you are not admissible, you may apply for a waiver on a\nForm I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant\n.\nQualifying Criminal Activities\nAbduction\nAbusive Sexual Contact\nBlackmail\nDomestic Violence\nExtortion\nFalse Imprisonment\nFemale Genital Mutilation\nFelonious Assault\nFraud in Foreign Labor Contracting\nHostage\nIncest\nInvoluntary Servitude\nKidnapping\nManslaughter\nMurder\nObstruction of Justice\nPeonage\nPerjury\nProstitution\nRape\nSexual Assault\nSexual Exploitation\nSlave Trade\nStalking\nTorture\nTrafficking\nWitness Tampering\nUnlawful Criminal Restraint\nOther Related Crimes*†\n*Includes any similar activity where the elements of the crime are substantially similar.\n†Also includes attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any of the above and other related crimes.\nApplying for U Nonimmigrant Status (U Visa)\nTo apply (petition) for a U nonimmigrant status, submit:\nForm I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status\nForm I-918, Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification\n. The Form I-918, Supplement B, must be signed by an\nauthorized official of the certifying law enforcement agency\nand the official must confirm that you were helpful, and currently being helpful, or will likely be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the case.\nIf any inadmissibility issues are present, you must file a\nForm I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as Nonimmigrant\n, to request a waiver of the inadmissibility;\nEvidence to establish each eligibility requirement.\nVisit our\nForms\nsection, specifically the Humanitarian Benefits Based Forms.\nYou may also apply (petition) for U nonimmigrant status if you are outside the United States. To do this, you must:\nFile all the necessary forms for U nonimmigrant status with the Vermont Service Center.\nFollow all instructions that are sent from the Vermont Service Center, which will include having your fingerprints taken at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\nIf your petition is approved, you must\nconsular process\nto enter the United States, which will include an interview with a consular officer at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\nInformation about your nearest United States Embassy or Consulate can be found at\nwww.usembassy.gov\n.\nSafe Address and Confidentiality Protections\nIf you do not feel safe receiving mail from USCIS at your home address, you may include a safe address on your application in the mailing address field. You do not have to be living at the safe address for USCIS to send mail to it. If you need to let USCIS know that you have changed your mailing address after you have filed a petition for U nonimmigrant status, see our\nChange of Address Procedures for VAWA/T/U Cases and Form I-751 Abuse Waivers\nwebpage.\nIf you apply for U nonimmigrant status with USCIS, any information about you or your petition for U nonimmigrant status is strictly confidential and is protected by law. DHS can only share this information in very limited circumstances and may not deny your petition based on evidence provided solely by your abuser or other prohibited sources.\nFiling for Qualifying Family Members\nCertain qualifying family members are eligible for a derivative U visa based on their relationship to you, the principal, filing for the U visa. The principal petitioner must have their petition for a U visa approved before their family members can be eligible for their own derivative U visa.\nIf you, the principal, are...\nThen...\nUnder 21 years of age\nYou may petition on behalf of your spouse, children, parents, and unmarried siblings under age 18\n21 years of age or older\nYou may petition on behalf of your spouse and children.\nTo petition for a qualified family member, you must file a\nForm I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient\n, at the same time as your application or at a later time.\nFees to File U Nonimmigrant Status Applications\nAll U nonimmigrant status applications (petitions) and other forms related to the U petition are filed with the USCIS Vermont Service Center.\nAll U nonimmigrant status applications (petitions) are fee exempt U nonimmigrant status petitioners and U nonimmigrants are fee exempt for all forms through adjustment of status.  You can find additional information on filing fees for our forms on our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nU Visa Extensions\nWhen U nonimmigrant status is granted, it is valid for four years. However,\nextensions are available in certain, limited circumstances if the extension is\n:\nNeeded based on a request from law enforcement,\nNeeded based on exceptional circumstances,\nNeeded due to delays in consular processing, or\nAutomatically extended upon the filing and pendency of an application for adjustment (application for a Green Card).\nU Visa Cap\nThe limit on the number of U visas that may be granted to principal petitioners each year is 10,000. However, there is no cap for family members deriving status from the principal applicant, such as spouses, children, or other eligible family members.\nIf the cap is reached before all U nonimmigrant petitions have been adjudicated, USCIS will create a waiting list for any eligible principal or derivative petitioners that are awaiting a final decision and a U visa. Petitioners placed on the waiting list will be granted deferred action or parole and are eligible to apply for work authorization while waiting for additional U visas to become available.\nOnce additional visas become available, petitioners on the waiting list and those who have received a bona fide determination will receive their visa in the order in which their petition was received. Petitioners do not have to take any additional steps to request the U visa. USCIS will notify the petitioner of the approval and the accompanying U visa.\nNote to Petitioners: Principal U nonimmigrant petitioners are employment authorized incident to status, after the underlying petition for U nonimmigrant status is approved and an employment authorization document is automatically issued without filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.\nDerivative family members residing inside the United States are also employment authorized incident to status, however an employment authorization document is not automatically issued. Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, may be filed for a derivative to obtain an employment authorization document.\nEmployment authorization for principals and derivatives can only be issued after the underlying U nonimmigrant status petition is approved, regardless of when the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, is filed.\nPrincipal petitioners and derivative family members living in the United States may receive employment authorization and deferred action if the underlying pending petition is bona fide, and they meet certain discretionary standards. USCIS will issue a notice if the principal petitioner or derivative family member needs to file a Form I-765 for employment authorization associated with a bona fide determination.\nIf the statutory cap is reached in a fiscal year and USCIS uses the waiting list process described at 8 CFR 214.14(d)(2), petitioners for U nonimmigrant status and derivatives in the United States can apply for employment authorization using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on deferred action.  An application for employment authorization based on deferred action can only be approved after DHS has deferred action in your case, regardless of when the Form I-765 is filed\nApplying for a Green Card\nYou may be eligible to apply for a Green Card (adjustment of status/permanent residence) if you meet certain requirements, including:\nYou have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least three years while in U nonimmigrant status, and\nYou have not unreasonably refused to provide assistance to law enforcement since you received your U visa.\nTo apply for permanent residence (a Green Card) for yourself or a qualifying family member, visit our\nGreen Card for a Victim of a Crime (U Nonimmigrant)\npage.\nPLEASE NOTE: Any qualifying family member who does not have a derivative U visa when the principal U nonimmigrant receives a Green Card is no longer eligible for a derivative U visa, but may still be eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence.\nFor information on extending your principal U visa to ensure your family member remains eligible for a U visa, please visit the\nT and U visa extension memorandum\n.\nFamily Members Deriving Status\nIf the family member deriving status based on your status has met the eligibility requirements for a Green Card, they may apply for lawful permanent residence by filing their own\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n.\nEven if your family members never had U nonimmigrant status or a U visa, they may still be eligible for a Green Card.\nFirst, you must file a\nForm I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Nonimmigrant\n, for each eligible family member.\nYou may file the Form I-929 at the same time or after you file your Form I-485.\nIf the Form I-929 for your family member(s) is approved:\nFamily members in the United States may file the Form I-485 to apply for a Green Card.\nFamily members outside the United States must first visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to obtain their immigrant visa. Information for the local U.S. embassy or consulate and the procedures for obtaining a visa to enter the United States may be found at\nwww.usembassy.gov\n.\nNOTE:\nThe Form I-929 is the form that is used to establish whether your family member is eligible to apply for a Green Card based on your U visa based lawful permanent resident status. This does not mean that your family member will receive a Green Card. Even if the Form I-929 is approved, your family member is not automatically eligible for work authorization. They are eligible to work once they have received their Green Card.\nFiling Form I-929\nAll Form I-929 applications are sent to the USCIS Vermont Service Center.\nPlease visit our\nGreen Card for a Victim of a Crime (U Nonimmigrant)\nweb page for more information.\nResources for Victims of Human Trafficking & Other Crimes\nUSCIS offers resources for victims of human trafficking and other crimes and the organizations that serve them.

      "content": "Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)\nAlert Type info\nALERT: Important Update on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\nOn Jan. 17, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\nissued a decision\nregarding the DACA Final Rule. Pursuant to the court’s order, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. USCIS will continue to accept initial requests but will not process initial DACA requests at this time. Current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated.\nAlert Type info\nALERT: Important Reminders Regarding the DACA Renewal Process\nWe continue to adjudicate the majority of DACA renewal requests within 120 days and make every effort to efficiently process these requests as we receive them.\nUSCIS Historical Data\nshows the median processing time for DACA renewals and associated Employment Authorization Documents in fiscal year 2023 was 1 month, and less than 2 months for the first quarter of FY 2024.\nAs USCIS has long recommended, we strongly encourage DACA recipients to submit your DACA renewal request to us between 120 and 150 days (4 to 5 months) before the expiration date located on your current Form I-797 DACA approval notice. Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Please note that filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision.\nAlert Type info\nALERT: Court decisions regarding DACA.\nOn Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the\nDACA Final Rule\nunlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021 injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” See the\nMemorandum and Order\nand\nSupplemental Order of Injunction\n.\nAccordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated.  In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, as it has since October 31, 2022. We will also continue to accept initial DACA requests, but in accordance with the District Court’s order, we will not process initial DACA requests.\nCurrent valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.\nPlease see the\nDACA Litigation Information Page\nfor important updates and information related to court rulings on the DACA policy.\nThis page provides information on requesting Consideration of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). You may request DACA for the first time or renew your existing period of DACA if it is expiring.\nPlease note:\nWhile a July 16, 2021,\ninjunction\nfrom the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was  affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and on Oct. 14, 2022 was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect, DHS is prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule.\nFile Online\nWhat Is DACA\nOn June 15, 2012, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced that certain people who came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of 2 years, subject to renewal. They are also eligible to request work authorization. Deferred action is an exercise of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal action against an individual for a certain period of time. Deferred action does not provide lawful status.\nOn Aug. 30, 2022, DHS published the DACA Final Rule, with the intent to preserve and fortify the DACA policy. This rule, which puts into effect regulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.25, rescinds and replaces the DACA guidance set forth in the 2012 Memorandum issued by Secretary Napolitano.\nRequest DACA for the First Time\nThe following information explains the guidelines for requesting DACA for the first time. Please note: While a July 16, 2021,\ninjunction\nfrom the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, which was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and on Oct. 14, 2022 was extended by the district court to the DACA final rule, remains in effect, DHS is prohibited from granting initial DACA requests and related employment authorization under the final rule. If you need further information and cannot find it in our\nFrequently Asked Questions\n, you can call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283.

An Employment Authorization Document will arrive separately in the mail.\nIn general, only aliens who have permission from DHS to work can apply for a Social Security number.  If USCIS grants DACA, you can find additional information about\nSocial Security Number and Card for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  (PDF)\non the\nSocial Security Administration\nwebsite.\nIf USCIS Does Not Grant DACA in Your Case\nIf USCIS denies your request for DACA, you cannot file an administrative appeal or a motion to reopen or reconsider. See 8 CFR 23.23(c)(3). USCIS will not review its discretionary determination to deny your request for DACA.\nUnder 8 CFR 236.23(c)(2), USCIS will not issue a Notice to Appear or refer a requestor’s case to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for possible enforcement action based on the denial of your DACA request unless we determine that your case involves denial for fraud, a threat to national security, or public safety concerns. For more information on notices to appear, visit\nuscis.gov/NTA\n.\nAdministrative Errors\nYou may request a review using the Service Request Management Tool process if you met all of the DACA guidelines and you believe USCIS denied your request because of an administrative error.\nExamples:\nUSCIS believes you abandoned your case by not responding to a request for evidence (RFE), and you believe you did respond within the prescribed time; or\nUSCIS mailed the RFE to the wrong address, even though you had submitted a Form AR-11, Change of Address, or changed your address online at\nuscis.gov\nbefore we issued the RFE.\nYou can find a full list of possible errors in our\nFrequently Asked Questions\n.\nTo make a service request, you must call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283. For people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833. A USCIS representative will then forward your request to the proper USCIS office. Your service request will be reviewed for accuracy and USCIS will send you a letter informing you of its decision.\nThe USCIS Contact Center is open Monday – Friday from 8 a.m. – 8 p.m. Eastern Time.\nTravel Information\nCertain travel outside the United States may affect the continuous residence guideline. Traveling outside the United States before Aug. 15, 2012, will not interrupt your continuous residence if the travel was brief, casual, and innocent. If you travel outside the United States on or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before we make a decision on your request for DACA, you will not be considered for DACA.\nThe following chart explains whether your travel will affect your continuous residence.\nTravel Dates\nType of Travel\nDoes it Affect Continuous Residence\nOn or after June 15, 2007, but before Aug. 15, 2012\nBrief,\nCasual, and\nInnocent\nNo\nFor an extended time\nBecause of an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal\nTo participate in criminal activity\nYes\nOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and before you have requested DACA\nAny\nYes. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case and you cannot travel until you receive advance parole.\nOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after you have requested DACA\nAny\nYes. You cannot travel while your request is under review. You cannot apply for advance parole unless and until DHS has determined whether to defer action in your case.\nIn addition, if you have previously been ordered deported and removed and you depart the United States without taking additional steps to address your removal proceedings, your departure will likely result in your being considered deported or removed, with potentially serious future immigration consequences.\nOn or after Aug. 15, 2012, and after receiving DACA\nAny\nIt depends.  If you travel after receiving advance parole, the travel will not interrupt your continuous residence.  However, if you engage in unauthorized travel, the travel may interrupt your continuous residence.\nOnce USCIS has approved your request for DACA, you may file\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, to request advance parole to travel outside of the United States. If you travel outside the United States without first receiving advance parole and then enter the United States without inspection, USCIS may terminate your DACA after issuing a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond. DACA recipients who depart the United States without first obtaining an advance parole document run a significant risk of being unable to reenter the United States; obtaining an advance parole document prior to departure is strongly encouraged to reduce the risk of being unable to return and resume DACA.\nFor detailed information see the\nTravel section\nof the Frequently Asked Questions.\nNational Security and Public Safety Guidelines\nYou will not be considered for DACA if you have been convicted of:\nA felony offense;\nA significant misdemeanor offense (as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)); or\n3 or more other misdemeanor offenses not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct.\nOr\nYou are otherwise deemed to pose a threat to national security or public safety.\nWhat is the difference between a “significant misdemeanor” (a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)), a “non-significant misdemeanor” (other misdemeanor), and a “felony”?\nFelony\nSignificant Misdemeanor (a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))\nNon-significant Misdemeanor (an “other misdemeanor” referenced at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6))\nA felony is a federal, state, or local criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year.\nA single conviction for a felony offense is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.\nA significant misdemeanor (that is, a misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) is a misdemeanor as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) and:\nRegardless of the sentence imposed, is an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; or,\nIf not an offense listed above, is an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of more than 90 days. The sentence must involve time to be served in custody, and does not include a suspended sentence.\nA single conviction for a misdemeanor offense as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) is disqualifying for purposes of DACA.\nA crime is considered a non-significant misdemeanor (referred to as “other misdemeanor” at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6)) as defined by federal law (specifically, a misdemeanor for which the maximum term of imprisonment authorized is 1 year or less but greater than 5 days) and:\nIs not an offense of domestic violence; sexual abuse or exploitation; burglary; unlawful possession or use of a firearm; drug distribution or trafficking; or driving under the influence; and\nIs an offense for which you were sentenced to time in custody of 90 days or less.\nThree or more convictions of “other misdemeanors” not occurring on the same date and not arising out of the same act, omission, or scheme of misconduct are disqualifying for purposes of DACA.\nA minor traffic offense is not considered a misdemeanor for purposes of 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) and is not per se disqualifying for DACA purposes. DHS considers such offenses in the totality of circumstances to determine if a requestor merits a favorable exercise of prosecutorial discretion. However, driving under the influence is a disqualifying misdemeanor as described at 8 CFR 236.22(b)(6) regardless of the sentence imposed.  You can find detailed information in the\nCriminal Convictions\nsection of the Frequent Asked Questions.\nDon’t Be a Victim of Immigration Scams\nDishonest practitioners may promise to provide you with faster services if you pay them a fee.

Eligible Hong Kong residents include those who have arrived in the United States since August 2021, as well as those who were covered under the initial decision. This extension provides Hong Kong residents who are concerned about returning to Hong Kong with temporary safe haven in the United States. We will issue a Federal Register notice as soon as possible to implement the president’s announcement.\nDED is in the president’s discretion to authorize as part of his constitutional power to conduct foreign relations. Although DED is not a specific immigration status, individuals covered by DED are not subject to removal from the United States, usually for a designated period of time.\nAlert Type info\nAlert:\nOn July 26, 2024, President Biden issued a Memorandum on the Deferred Enforced Departure for Certain Lebanese Nationals to the secretaries of state and homeland security authorizing DED and employment authorization for 18 months for eligible Lebanese nationals.

Additionally, we may publish a Federal Register notice announcing automatic extensions. The notice will tell you if we are automatically extending your EAD and until what date.\nIf we announce an automatic extension, and if you otherwise remain eligible for DED, you may show your DED-related EAD with an expired Card Expires date and a copy of the Federal Register notice to employers and government agencies (federal, state, and local). Employers may rely on the Federal Register notice as evidence that your EAD is still valid.\nIf you are an employer or government agency with questions or concerns about an automatic EAD extension, you may contact:\nUSCIS Form I-9 Support: 888-464-4218\nU.S. Department of Justice, Immigrant, and Employee Rights Section (IER) Employer Hotline: 800-255-8155\nIf you are an employee with questions or concerns about the automatic EAD extension, you may contact the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Immigrant and Employee Rights Section Worker Hotline at 800-255-7688.\nTravel Outside the United States\nIf DHS provides travel authorization as a benefit of your DED, you must file for advance parole if you wish to travel. Advance parole gives you permission to leave the United States and return during a specified period. To request advance parole, you must file\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n.\nIf you leave the United States without first receiving advance parole, you may no longer be eligible for DED and may not be permitted to reenter the United States.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n08/22/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

We also sent notices to any representatives of these aliens listed on Form G-28.\nIf you have a pending Form I-589, Public Law 119-21 (P.L. 119-21) requires you to pay an AAF of $100 for each calendar year your application is pending, in addition to any other fee. You cannot get a waiver for the AAF.\nIf you receive a notice, you should pay the fee within 30 days. If you do not pay this fee, it may negatively affect your application, including, but not limited to, a delay in processing.\nYou must pay this fee online at\nhttps://my.uscis.gov/accounts/annual-asylum-fee/start/overview\n. You will need your Alien Registration Number (A-Number) and the Receipt Number at the top of your notice to pay the fee.\nAlert Type info\nStarting Aug. 14, 2024, asylum officers conducting threshold screening interviews (TSI) for alien who are processed pursuant to the U.S.-Canada Third Country Agreement (STCA) will consider credible testimony, documents, and other reliable evidence available at the time of the TSI. Additional documentary evidence may not be submitted after the interview concludes. A lack of documentary evidence alone does not preclude alien from establishing that they qualify for an exception to the STCA.\nAdditionally, DHS will set the consultation period for aliens awaiting the TSI to a minimum of four hours beginning at the time the alien is provided an opportunity to consult with a person of the alien’s choosing and continuing only during the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. local time.\nAlert Type info\nALERT: Court Order on Circumvention of Lawful Pathways Final Rule\nOn Aug. 3, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued a stay of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California’s order in\nEast Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden\n, 18-cv-06810 (N.D. Cal.), vacating the\nCircumvention of Lawful Pathways (CLP) rule\n. USCIS continued to apply the CLP rule during the stay. On April 10, 2025, the Ninth Circuit vacated its prior order staying proceedings and the district court’s judgment and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. Although the CLP rule sunsetted on May 12, 2025, its provisions remain applicable to those who entered the United States between May 12, 2023, and May 11, 2025. Until the district court renders a decision, USCIS will continue to apply the CLP rule where appropriate.\nUnder the rule, certain individuals who entered the United States through its southwest land border or adjacent coastal borders are presumed to be ineligible for asylum, unless they can demonstrate an exception to the rule or rebut the presumption.\nEvery year people come to the United States seeking protection because they have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution due to:\nRace\nReligion\nNationality\nMembership in a particular social group\nPolitical opinion\nYou may only file this application if you are physically present in the United States, and you are not a U.S. citizen.\nAt this time, the option to file an online Form I-589 is only available for certain affirmative asylum applicants. Affirmative asylum applicants may not file an online Form I-589 if they:\nAre in proceedings in immigration court or before the Board of Immigration Appeals;\nAre an unaccompanied alien child as defined in 6 U.S.C. § 279(g) and are in removal proceedings;\nAre among the categories of applicants who must currently file by mail with the Asylum Vetting Center as outlined in the Special Instructions section of our\nForm I-589\nwebpage; or\nAlready submitted a Form I-589, which is still pending with USCIS.\nIf you are eligible for asylum you may be permitted to remain in the United States. To apply for asylum affirmatively or defensively, file a\nForm I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal\n, within 1 year of your arrival to the United States. Visit our\nObtaining Asylum in the United States\npage for more information on affirmative and defensive filings.\nYou may include your spouse and children who are physically present in the United States as dependents on your affirmative or defensive asylum application at the time you file or at any time until a final decision is made on your application. To include your child as a dependent on your application, the child must be under 21 years old and unmarried. For more information see our\nForm I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal\npage.\nIf you were placed in expedited removal proceedings, you received a positive credible fear determination, and USCIS retained your asylum application for further consideration in an Asylum Merits Interview, please visit our\nAsylum Merits Interview with USCIS: Processing After a Positive Credible Fear Determination\npage.\nIf you have an asylum application pending with us, you can check the status of your application at\nCase Status Online\n. You will need the receipt number that we provided you after you filed your application.\nPermission to Work in the United States\nTo apply for employment authorization and an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), you must file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. For more information, see the\nForm I-765\nwebpage.\nBased on a Pending Asylum Application:\nYou are generally eligible for an EAD when your asylum application has been pending for 180 days. To apply for an EAD based on your pending asylum application under the (c)(8) category, you may file Form I-765 150 days after you file your asylum application. You are not eligible to receive an EAD until your asylum application has been pending for at least another 30 days, for a total of 180 days. This is commonly referred to as the 180-Day Asylum EAD Clock.\nDelays that you request or cause while your asylum application is pending with an asylum office or with the Executive Office for Immigration Review do not count toward the 180-day eligibility period.\nDelays you may request or cause may include:\nAsking to transfer a case to a new asylum office or interview location, including when the transfer is based on your change of address;\nAsking to reschedule an interview for a later date;\nFailing to appear at an interview or biometrics appointment;\nFailing to provide a competent interpreter at an interview (if required);\nAsking to provide additional evidence at or after an interview;\nSubmitting large volumes of evidence immediately before an interview that requires a reschedule; or\nFailing to receive and acknowledge an asylum decision in person (if required).\nIf you are required to receive and acknowledge your asylum decision at an asylum office but you fail to appear, your 180-Day Asylum EAD Clock will stop, and you may be ineligible to receive employment authorization. If your case has been referred to an immigration court, your 180-Day Asylum EAD Clock will not start again until your first hearing with an immigration judge.\nIf you fail to appear for a scheduled asylum interview without good cause, or fail without good cause to provide a competent interpreter if you are required to do so, we may refer your Form I-589 to an immigration judge, and you will be ineligible for employment authorization based on your pending Form I-589. For additional information about establishing good cause, please review our\nEstablishing Good Cause or Exceptional Circumstances\nwebpage.\nFor more information regarding employment authorization and applicant-caused delays, see\nThe 180-Day Asylum EAD Clock Notice\n. If we approve your application for employment authorization based on your pending asylum application, your EAD will be valid for up to 5 years.\nAfter your asylum application is adjudicated:\nIf you are granted asylum, you are immediately authorized to work. (Some asylees choose to obtain EADs for convenience or identification purposes, but you do not need an EAD to work if you are an asylee.) If we approve your affirmative asylum application, we will mail an EAD to your address of record. If you do not receive your EAD within 90 days of your asylum grant, you may call the\nUSCIS Contact Center\n. When you call, indicate that you are calling about an auto EAD. You may also contact us by clicking on “Connect to Live Agent” in the Chat with Emma feature on our website. Have your Form I-589 receipt available when you call us about your EAD. If you were granted asylum by an immigration judge, you must file Form I-765 to obtain an EAD.\nIf you are denied asylum, your employment authorization will terminate when your EAD expires or 60 days after your asylum application is denied, whichever is later. If you are not in lawful immigration status or an unexpired period of parole, and an asylum officer “refers” your asylum application to an immigration judge for further consideration, your EAD will remain valid through the expiration date on your EAD. If an immigration judge denies your asylum application, your employment authorization will terminate on the expiration date printed on your EAD, unless you appeal the immigration judge’s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) or, after BIA review, you appeal the BIA’s decision to a federal circuit court. You may be otherwise eligible for employment authorization if you are a valid immigrant or nonimmigrant or are in an unexpired period of parole or temporary protected status.\nALERT: If you are applying for your initial (first) employment authorization based on having a pending asylum application, you may be a member of the class action case, Rosario v. USCIS, Case No. C15-0813JLR (W.D. Wash. July 26, 2018). To learn more, visit the\nRosario Class Action page.\nRemote Participation by Your Attorney or Accredited Representative at Your Asylum or NACARA 203 Interview.\nIf you are scheduled for an asylum or NACARA 203 interview at an asylum office and you have an attorney or an accredited representative, they may participate in your interview remotely by telephone.\nTo participate remotely, they must complete\nForm G-1593, Certification by Attorney or Accredited Representative for Remote Participation in an Affirmative Asylum and/or NACARA 203 Interview\n, and submit it to the asylum office where we have scheduled your interview.\nPlease carefully read the information on Form G-1593 and consult with your attorney or accredited representative to determine whether you want them to participate remotely.\nBringing Your Family to the United States\nIf you are granted asylum you may petition to bring your spouse and children to the United States by filing a\nForm I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition\n. To include your child on your application, the child must be under 21 and unmarried.\nYou must file the petition within 2 years of being granted asylum unless there are humanitarian reasons to excuse this deadline. There is no fee to file this petition.\nFiling for Permanent Residence (Green Card)\nYou may be approved for a Green Card 1 year after being granted asylum. To apply for a Green Card, file a\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or to Adjust Status\n. You must submit a separate Form I-485 application packet for yourself and, if applicable, for each family member who received derivative asylum based on your application.\nFor more information about Green Cards, see our\nGreen Cards for Asylees\npage. For more information about asylum, see our\nAsylum Questions and Answers\npage.\nRelated Links\nAsylum News\nAsylum and Refugee News Releases\nAsylum and Refugee Alerts\nUSCIS Welcomes Refugees and Asylees\nAsylum\nHow USCIS Processes a Form I-589 Filed After Removal Proceedings are Dismissed or Terminated\nJ.O.P.

      "content": "Victims of Human Trafficking: T Nonimmigrant Status\nT nonimmigrant status is a temporary immigration benefit. It enables certain victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons to remain in the United States for an initial period of up to 4 years if they complied with any reasonable request for assistance from law enforcement in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of human trafficking or qualify for an exemption or exception. T nonimmigrant status is also available to certain eligible family members of trafficking victims. T nonimmigrants are eligible for employment authorization and\ncertain federal and state benefits and services\n. T nonimmigrants who qualify may also be able to adjust their status and become lawful permanent residents (get a Green Card).\nCongress created this nonimmigrant status (commonly referred to as a T visa) in October 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. Human trafficking, also known as trafficking in persons, is a crime in which traffickers use force, fraud, or coercion to compel individuals to provide labor or services, including commercial sex. Traffickers often take advantage of vulnerable individuals, including those lacking lawful immigration status. T visas offer protection to victims and strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate and prosecute human trafficking.\nUnder federal law, a “severe form of trafficking in persons” is:\nSex trafficking\n: When someone recruits, harbors, transports, provides, solicits, patronizes, or obtains a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act, where the commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or the person being induced to perform such act is under 18 years of age; or\nLabor trafficking\n: When someone recruits, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains a person for labor or services using force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery.\nEligibility for T Nonimmigrant Status\nYou may be eligible for T nonimmigrant status if you:\nAre or were a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons as defined above;\nAre physically present in the United States, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or at a port of entry because you were trafficked;\nComplied with any reasonable request from a law enforcement agency for assistance in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of human trafficking (unless you were under the age of 18 at the time at least 1 of the acts of trafficking occurred or you are unable to cooperate due to physical or psychological trauma; if either case applies, you may not need to show that you complied with reasonable requests from law enforcement);\nShow that you would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm if you were removed from the United States; and\nAre admissible to the United States. If you are not admissible, you may be eligible for a waiver of certain grounds of inadmissibility. You may apply for a waiver using a\nForm I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant\n.\nApplying for T Nonimmigrant Status\nTo apply for T nonimmigrant status, you must submit:\nForm I-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status\n, including a personal statement describing the trafficking you are or were subjected to;\nEvidence to establish that you complied with any reasonable request for assistance from law enforcement, or that you qualify for an exception or exemption. You may submit\nForm I-914, Supplement B, Declaration for Trafficking Victim\n,\nto demonstrate that you are a victim of trafficking and that you have complied with any reasonable request to assist law enforcement. However, you may also choose to submit other evidence instead of or in addition to the Form I-914, Supplement B, such as records of your communication with law enforcement, trial transcripts, court documents, police reports, news articles, affidavits, or other relevant credible evidence;\nEvidence to show that you meet all other eligibility requirements; and\nEvidence to demonstrate that you are admissible, or\nForm I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant\n,\nseeking a waiver of applicable inadmissibility grounds, if you are inadmissible.\nFees\nApplicants for T nonimmigrant status and T nonimmigrants are fee exempt from all forms through adjustment of status.  You can find additional information on filing fees for our forms on our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nSafe Address and Confidentiality Protections\nIf you do not feel safe receiving mail from USCIS at your home address, you may include a safe address on your application in the mailing address field. You do not have to be living at the safe address for us to send mail to it. If you need to let us know that you changed your mailing address after you filed an application for T nonimmigrant status, see our\nChange of Address Procedures for VAWA/T/U Cases and Form I-751 Abuse Waivers\nwebpage.\nIf you apply for T nonimmigrant status with USCIS, any information about you or your application for T nonimmigrant status is strictly confidential and is protected by law. DHS can only share this information in very limited circumstances and may not deny your application based on evidence provided solely by your trafficker.\nEligible Family Members\nCertain eligible family members may be eligible for T nonimmigrant status. Regardless of your age, you may apply for the following family members if they are in present danger of retaliation because of your escape from trafficking or cooperation with law enforcement:\nYour parents;\nYour unmarried siblings under 18 years of age; and\nThe children of any age or marital status of your eligible family members who have been granted derivative T nonimmigrant status.\nIf your family members are not in present danger of retaliation, then follow the chart below:\nIf you are…\nThen you may apply for your...\nUnder 21 years old\nSpouse\nUnmarried children who are under 21 years old\nParents\nUnmarried siblings who are under 18 years old\n21 years old or older\nSpouse\nUnmarried children who are under 21 years old\nTo apply for an eligible family member, you must file\nForm I-914, Supplement A, Application for Derivative T Nonimmigrant Status\n. You may file Form I-914, Supplement A, at the same time as your Form I-914, or while your application is pending, or while you are in T nonimmigrant status\nBona Fide Determination Process\nWe have authority to provide deferred action and employment authorization to aliens with pending, bona fide T nonimmigrant status applications. Effective Aug. 28, 2024, we implemented a modified bona fide determination process. This process generally applies to all applications for T nonimmigrant status filed on or after that date by applicants and their eligible family members who are in the United States. To receive deferred action and employment authorization, you\nmust\nfile Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, under 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(40). If you have filed a bona fide Form I-914 or Form I-914, Supplement A, but have not filed an accompanying Form I-765, we will notify you that we have deemed your application bona fide, and we will invite you to file Form I-765 to be considered for deferred action and employment authorization.\nPlease note:\nWe strongly encourage you to file your application for T nonimmigrant status and your Form I-765 under category (c)(40)\nconcurrently\n. If you wait to file Form I-765, it will take longer to process. In addition, if you are a principal applicant with derivative family members, they will not receive deferred action and employment authorization until you receive deferred action and employment authorization. If you have a pending Form I-765 filed under category (a)(16) or (c)(25), we may convert it to the (c)(40) category to process the Employment Authorization Document more efficiently.\nEmployment Authorization\nWhether you need to file\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, depends on whether you are a principal applicant or eligible family member.\nPrincipal applicants\n: If you are granted T nonimmigrant status, we will provide you with an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) at the same time we approve your Form I-914. We use the information from your Form I-914 to generate the EAD, which is also known as a work permit. You do not need to file Form I-765 with the application for T nonimmigrant status. However, to receive a bona fide determination for deferred action and employment authorization, you must submit Form I-765, and we recommend you submit it concurrently with your Form I-914.\nEligible family members\n: If you are included as an eligible family member on Form I-914, Supplement A, and you are living in the United States, you must submit Form I-765 if you want to apply for an EAD. You may file Form I-765 together with Form I-914, Supplement A, or later. If you live outside the United States, you are not eligible to receive an EAD until you are lawfully admitted to the United States. Do not file Form I-765 if you are living outside the United States.\nAfter You Obtain T Nonimmigrant Status\nT nonimmigrant status is generally granted for 4 years. In certain situations, you may be able to extend your T nonimmigrant status by filing\nForm I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status\n.\nAdditionally, you may be eligible for lawful permanent residence (a Green Card) after 3 years of continuous physical presence in the United States since you were lawfully admitted as a T nonimmigrant, or if you maintained continuous physical presence in the United States during the investigation or prosecution of the trafficking that is now complete, whichever occurs earlier. For detailed information about the eligibility requirements, see\nGreen Card for a Victim of Trafficking (T Nonimmigrant)\n.\nEligibility for Services and Benefits\nIf you have T nonimmigrant status, you are eligible for several federally funded benefits and services. If you do not yet have T nonimmigrant status but are a victim of trafficking, you may also be eligible for these benefits and services if:\nThe DHS Center for Countering Human Trafficking (CCHT) has granted you\nContinued Presence  (PDF)\n; or\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has provided you with a\nletter of certification or eligibility\n.\nOther Resources\nT Visa Law Enforcement Resource Guide\nU nonimmigrant status:\nVictims of human trafficking may also be eligible to apply for U nonimmigrant status (U visa). See\nVictims of Criminal Activity, U Nonimmigrant Status\n.\nContinued Presence:\nCCHT may grant Continued Presence for an initial period of 2 years to victims of human trafficking to provide immediate temporary relief from removal from the United States. Victims must meet certain requirements, and only a federal law enforcement agency (such as ICE or the FBI) may request Continued Presence for an individual. Those granted Continued Presence are eligible to apply for employment authorization as well as federal services and benefits. For more information, see\nCCHT’s Continued Presence fact sheet  (PDF)\nand\nContinued Presence Resource Guide\n.\nUSCIS resources:\nFind information for victims and organizations that help them at\nResources for Victims of Human Trafficking & Other Crimes\n.\nInformation for law enforcement:\nLearn about law enforcement’s role in supporting applications for T nonimmigrant status and other relief for victims of human trafficking and other crimes at\nInformation for Law Enforcement Agencies and Judges\n.\nNational Human Trafficking Hotline:\nTo report suspected human trafficking and receive support and services to get help and information on how to stay safe, call 1-888-373-7888.
