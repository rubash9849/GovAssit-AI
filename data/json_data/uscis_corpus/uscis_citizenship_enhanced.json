      "content": "Commonly Asked Questions About the Naturalization Process\nUSCIS has developed responses to several frequently asked questions related to the naturalization process, interview, and test.\nDo I need a lawyer to apply for U.S. citizenship?\nYou can file USCIS forms yourself, including the\nForm N-400, Application for Naturalization\n, which can be\nsubmitted online\n. However, due to the complexity of individual cases, some people choose to seek assistance from a lawyer or an accredited representative whose names appear on lists maintained by the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). For more information about EOIR-accredited representatives, visit\nDOJ’s Recognition & Accreditation (R&A) Program\nwebpage.\nIf you decide to get legal assistance, you can start here:\nLegal services\nMany people offer to help with immigration services. Unfortunately, not all of them are authorized or qualified to do so. If you are seeking legal help to complete your Form N-400, please be aware that only attorneys and EOIR-accredited representatives can:\nprovide legal advice about which forms and documents to attach to your application,\nexplain immigration options you may have, and\ncommunicate with USCIS about your case.\nFor additional information, please review USCIS’ guidance on the\nunauthorized practice of immigration law\n.\nIf you decide to submit Form N-400 without legal assistance, you can find information about the naturalization application process at the Citizenship Resource Center (CRC). Also visit the\nN-400, Application for Naturalization\nwebpage and read the instructions.\nDoes USCIS provide study materials and resources for aliens to use when preparing for the test?\nYes. USCIS provides educational resources to help aliens prepare for the naturalization test. Study materials and resources can be found on the CRC.\nWill I be asked all of the civics test questions during the naturalization interview?\n2025 Naturalization Civics Test\nUSCIS will administer the 2025 naturalization civics test to aliens who file Form N-400 to apply for naturalization on or after Oct. 20, 2025.\nThe 2025 naturalization civics test is an oral test, and the USCIS officer at your interview will ask you up to 20 questions from the list of 128 civics test questions. You must answer 12 questions correctly to pass the 2025 civics test. You will fail the test if you answer 9 of the 20 questions incorrectly.\nBecause my lawful permanent resident status allows me to travel between the United States and my home country, can I live in both places until I am ready to apply for citizenship?\nGenerally, to qualify for citizenship, you must demonstrate that you have\ncontinuously resided\nin the United States for at least 5 years before submitting Form N-400. This means you must be residing exclusively in the United States – not in any other country.\nYou may travel to another country, including your home country, if no other legal impediment precludes you from doing so. However, if your trip lasts longer than 180 days, USCIS may determine that you have not continuously resided in the United States and therefore are ineligible for naturalization.\nIn addition to examining the length of your trip abroad, USCIS will look at the frequency of your travel. To qualify for naturalization, an applicant must spend at least half of their time in the United States. This is known as the “\nphysical presence\n” requirement. If you take frequent, short trips abroad that result in you spending more than half your time outside the United States, then you will also be ineligible for naturalization.\nThe requirements of “continuous residence” and “physical presence” are interrelated but are different requirements. An applicant applying for naturalization must satisfy each eligibility requirement.\nWill USCIS approve my Form N-400 once I pass the reading, writing, and civics portions of the naturalization test?\nIn addition to preparing for the reading, writing, and civics portion of the naturalization test, you must meet all other eligibility requirements. This includes the ability to speak and understand English. The speaking test occurs during the eligibility interview on Form N-400.\nDuring your naturalization interview, a USCIS officer will review the responses you provided on your\nForm N-400\n, with you. The USCIS officer will ask questions to clarify or confirm your responses. Prepare to demonstrate your ability to speak and understand English by making sure you understand each question on the application and can respond to each question according to your situation.\nApplicants may ask the USCIS officer to repeat or rephrase questions during the naturalization interview. Certain applicants because of age and time as a lawful permanent resident are exempt from the English requirements for naturalization and may take the civics test in the language of their choice. For more information, see\nexceptions and accommodations\n.\nCan I legally change my name while my Form N-400 is pending?\nYes. You can legally change your name while your Form N-400 is pending. If your name has changed after you filed an N-400, you must promptly provide USCIS with the document(s) that legally changed your name(s), such as a marriage certificate, divorce decree, court order, or other official record. Make sure to mention your name change and bring the documents related to your name change at the time of the interview.\nYou can also legally change your name when you naturalize. The instructions to Form N-400 include information on what is required when you wish to change your name at the time of naturalization. At the time of the interview, the USCIS officer will record the name change request and ask you to sign a name change petition, which USCIS files with a court before the judicial oath ceremony. Upon receipt of the petition, the court signs and seals the petition. The petition is later presented to you during the naturalization ceremony as evidence of the name change.\nAll name change requests facilitated through USCIS will require you to take the Oath of Allegiance at a judicial ceremony, rather than an administrative one because USCIS is not authorized to make name changes. As far as possible delays, USCIS has little control over the judicial ceremony calendar. However, most courts are accommodating of the need for naturalization ceremonies.\nDo I need to bring original documents such as birth and marriage certificates to the naturalization interview?\nYes. The instructions to Form N-400 provide an extensive list of examples of original documents that you should bring to the interview, depending on different case scenarios. Examples of these documents include original birth, marriage, divorce, final adoption and naturalization certificates; court orders/decrees; evidence of child support payments; court-certified arrest reports; and probation/parole records. Certain certified copies of documents can also be provided. You should also submit copies, preferably certified copies, of these documents at the initial filing of your application. These documents should be submitted as evidence in support of your application and will facilitate the USCIS officers’ review of your request.\nWhat should I do if I have already applied for naturalization and my Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) is expiring?\nWhile lawful permanent resident status does not expire, barring naturalization or termination of status, a lawful permanent resident must have valid, unexpired proof of lawful permanent residence in their possession at all times. Applying for naturalization does not change this requirement. However, effective Dec. 12, 2022, an alien applying for naturalization who properly submits Form N-400 will receive a Form N-400 receipt notice that, when presented with their permanent resident card (Green Card), automatically extends the validity of the Green Card for 24 months from the “Card Expires” date. This receipt notice must be presented to show that your Green Card, which is proof of your lawful permanent resident status, has been extended, such as for purposes of employment or travel authorization. If your Green Card has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then you generally must file\nForm, I-90 Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card\n. For more information on how to replace your Green Card, visit the\nReplace Your Green Card\nwebpage.\nIf I fail a portion of the naturalization test, when will I be retested?\nYou will be given two opportunities to meet the English and civics requirements of the naturalization test. If you fail any portion of these requirements during your first attempt, you will be retested during a new interview on the portion of the test that you failed (English or civics) between 60 and 90 days from the date of your initial interview.\nHow many times can I apply for naturalization?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can apply for naturalization, but you must pay the filing fee for each Form N-400 you submit to USCIS.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n10/20/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

However, some of the content may still be useful, so we have archived the page.\nThank you for visiting U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) online and reviewing our website privacy policy. USCIS is a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Our privacy policy explains how we handle the personally identifiable information (PII) that you provide to us when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. PII includes information that is personal in nature and which may be used to identify you. You may provide PII to us when you email us or send a request for information, when you fill out a questionnaire or satisfaction survey, when you participate in a research study, etc. We do not require you to register or provide PII to visit our website. We do collect some technical information that does not include PII when you visit to make your visit seamless. The section below explains how we handle and collect information when you visit\nwww.uscis.gov\n.\nThe PII you provide on a DHS website will be used only for the purpose for which you provided it. We will protect your information consistent with the principles of the\nPrivacy Act of 1974\n, the\nE-Government Act of 2002\n, and the\nFederal Records Act\n.\nPersonally Identifiable Information\nAs a general rule, DHS does not collect PII about you when you visit our website, unless you choose to provide such information to us. Submitting PII through our website is voluntary. By doing so, you are giving DHS your permission to use the information for a specific, stated purpose. However, not providing certain information may prevent us from providing you with the service you desire.\nIf you choose to provide us with PII on a DHS website, through such methods as completing a web form, we will use that information to help us provide you the information or service you have requested. The information we may receive from you varies based on what you do when visiting our site.\nWe only share the PII you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give your PII to any private organizations. We never collect information for commercial marketing.\nIf we store your PII in a record system designed to retrieve information about you by personal identifier (name, personal email address, home mailing address, personal or mobile phone number, etc.), so that we may contact you, we will safeguard the information you provide to us in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). The Privacy Act requires all public-facing sites or forms that request PII to prominently and conspicuously display a privacy notice.\nThe notice must address the following criteria:\nLegal authorization to collect information about you;\nPurpose for which the information will be used;\nRoutine uses for disclosure of information outside of the Department of Homeland Security;\nWhether your providing the information is voluntary or mandatory under law; and\nResults if you choose to not provide the requested information.\nFor the general contact information that may be submitted through\nwww.uscis.gov\n, we have completed a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and System of Records Notice (SORN) providing details about the privacy protections and redress options available for the contact information we collect from the public. We may use this information to provide you with information and to perform various administrative tasks. For further information, please reference the privacy compliance documentation below:\nDHS/ALL/PIA-006\nDepartment of Homeland Security General Contact Lists  (PDF)\nPrivacy Impact Assessment (April 25, 2019)\nDHS/ALL-002\nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) Mailing and Other Lists\nSystem of Records Notice (November 25, 2008, 73 FR 71659)\nEmail Communications\nMany of our programs and websites allow you to send us email messages. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry. We will only send you general information via email. You should be reminded that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. Therefore, we suggest that you do not send sensitive PII (such as your Social Security number) to us via email. If your intended email communication is sensitive, e.g., it includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or Social Security number, you should instead send it by U.S. mail. You may also submit data through a secure program website, if available.\nElectronic mail messages that meet the definition of records in the\nFederal Records Act\n(44 U.S.C. § 3101) are covered under the same disposition schedule as all other federal records. This means that emails you send us will be preserved and maintained for varying periods of time if those emails meet the definition of federal records. Electronic messages that are not records are deleted when no longer needed.\nInformation Collected and Stored Automatically\nWhen you browse through any website, certain information about your visit can be collected. We automatically collect the following types of information about your visit:\nDomain from which you access the Internet;\nIP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to a computer when navigating the internet);\nOperating system and information about the device or browser used when visiting the site;\nDate and time of your visit;\nContent you visited or downloaded; and,\nWebsite (such as google.com or bing.com) or referral source (email notice or social media site) that connected you to the website.\nDHS uses a variety of different web measurement software tools.\nDHS uses Google Analytics measurement software to collect the information listed above. The data are automatically sent to Google’s system and the system immediately aggregates the data. Neither DHS nor Google ever have access to the specifics of your particular site visits. The staff can only see the aggregate data from all users for a particular time period.\nDHS gathers this information to improve our websites and has chosen to not share the aggregate data with Google. We may use the aggregated data to share with our partners and contractors to help improve visitor experiences.\nDHS also uses online surveys to collect opinions and feedback from a random sample of visitors. DHS uses the Foresee Results American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) online survey to obtain feedback and data on visitors’ satisfaction with DHS websites. This survey does not collect PII. Participation in the survey is voluntary. If you decline to take the survey, you will still have access to the identical information and resources on the website as those who take the survey. Answers to the survey help us improve our website to make it easier to use and more responsive to the needs of our visitors.\nDHS staff conduct analyses and reports on the aggregated data from the ACSI survey. The reports are only available to website managers, members of their communications and web teams, and other designated staff who require this information to perform their duties.\nDHS retains the data from Google Analytics, and ACSI survey results only as long as required by law or needed to support the mission of the DHS websites.\nOmnichannel Survey\nPaperwork Reduction Act Statement\nAn agency may not conduct or sponsor an information collection and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated at 5 minute per response. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to: External Affairs Directorate, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 5900 Capital Gateway Drive – Mail Stop 2040, Camp Springs, MD 20588-0009.

Cookies from our web pages only collect information about your browser’s visit to the site; they do not collect any personal information about you.\nThere are two types of cookies, single session (temporary), and multi-session (persistent). Session cookies last only as long as your web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies are stored on your computer for longer periods.\nSession Cookies: We use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through our site. These cookies let our server know that you are continuing a visit to our site. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of session cookies as \"Usage Tier 1-Single Session.” The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of single session web measurement and customization technologies.\"\nPersistent Cookies: We use persistent cookies to enable Google Analytics to differentiate between new and returning visitors to our site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer between visits to our sites for six months. We also use persistent cookies to block repeated invitations to take the ACSI survey. The persistent cookies that block repeated survey invitations expire in 90 days. The OMB Memo 10-22 Guidance defines our use of persistent cookies as \"Usage Tier 2-Multi-session without Personally Identifiable Information (PII).” The policy says, \"This tier encompasses any use of multi-session web measurement and customization technologies when no PII is collected.\"\nIf you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can\nopt out or disable cookies\nin your browser.

We use social media websites to engage in dialogue, share information and media, and collaborate with the public. We may also use these websites to make information and services widely available, while promoting transparency and accountability, as a service for those seeking information about or services from DHS. The privacy policies for approved social media platforms are linked to the right of this privacy policy. We have have also published two Privacy Impact Assessments detailing our use of social media:\nDHS/ALL/PIA-031\nUse of Social Networking Interactions and Applications Communications/Outreach/Public Dialogue  (PDF)\n(September 16, 2010)\nDHS/ALL/PIA-036\nUse of Unidirectional Social Media Applications  (PDF)\n(March 8, 2011)\nDHS does not use third-party websites to solicit and collect PII from individuals. DHS will not transmit or store any PII collected by the third-party website; no PII will be disclosed, sold or transferred to any other entity outside DHs, unless required for law enforcement purposes or by statute consistent with the Privacy Act.\nSite Security\nDHS takes the security of all PII very seriously. We take precautions to maintain the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the information we collect at this site. Such measures include access controls designed to limit access to the information to the extent necessary to accomplish our mission. We also employ various security technologies to protect the information stored on our systems. We routinely test our security measures to ensure that they remain operational and effective.\nFor site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.\nExcept for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.\nUnauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.\nInteraction with Children Online\nDHS is committed to the protection of children’s online privacy. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) governs information gathered online from or about children under the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting, using, or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. If a DHS website intends to collect information from children under 13 years old, COPPA-required information and instructions will be provided by the specific web page that collects information about the child. The web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept.\nVisiting Other Websites\nOur website contains links to international agencies, private organizations, and some commercial entities. These websites are not within our control and may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility polices. Once you link to another site, you are subject to the policies of that site. All federal websites, however, are subject to the same federal policy, security, and accessibility mandates.\nPrivacy Policy Contact Information\nWe welcome feedback if you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or the use of your information.

      "content": "I am the Child of a U.S. Citizen\nCitizenship Through U.S. Parents\nThere are two general ways to obtain citizenship through U.S. citizen parents: at birth, and after birth but before the age of 18. Congress has enacted laws that determine how citizenship is conveyed by a U.S. citizen parent (or parents) to children born outside of the United States.\nWho May Qualify for Acquisition of Citizenship\nThe law in effect at the time of birth determines whether someone born outside the United States to a U.S. citizen parent (or parents) is a U.S. citizen at birth. In general, these laws require that at least one parent was a U.S. citizen, and the U.S. citizen parent had lived in the United States for a period of time.\nIn addition, children born abroad may become U.S. citizens after birth. For information and eligibility requirements for specific time periods, see the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 12,\nPart H, Children of U.S. Citizens\n.\nDefinition of Child\nIn general, a\nchild\nfor citizenship and naturalization provisions is an unmarried person who is:\nThe genetic, legitimated, or\nadopted son or daughter of a U.S. citizen\n; or\nThe son or daughter of a non-genetic gestational U.S. citizen mother who is recognized by the relevant jurisdiction as the child’s legal parent.\nFor more information, see the\nUSCIS Policy Manual, Volume 12, Part H, Children of U.S. Citizens\n.\nChildren of U.S. Citizens Residing in the United States\nChildren who were born outside the U.S. but now live in the U.S. may acquire citizenship under Section 320 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). A child born outside of the United States automatically becomes a U.S. citizen when all of the following conditions have been met on or after Feb. 27, 2001:\nThe child has at least one parent, including an adoptive parent, who is a U.S. citizen by birth or through naturalization;\nThe child is under 18 years of age;\nThe child is a\nlawful permanent resident\n(LPR); and\nThe child is residing in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent.\nFor more information, see the USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 12,\nPart H, Children of U.S. Citizens\n.\nTo apply for a\nCertificate of Citizenship\nunder INA 320, see our\nForm N-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship\npage and read the instructions carefully to ensure that you qualify.\nFor more information on the form, visit our\nN-600, Application for Certificate of Citizenship Frequently Asked Questions\npage.\nChildren of U.S. Citizens Residing Outside the United States\nChildren residing outside of the United States may obtain citizenship under Section 322 of the INA. A child who regularly resides outside of the United States is eligible for naturalization if all of the following conditions have been met:\nThe child has at least one parent, including an adoptive parent, who is a U.S. citizen by birth or through naturalization;\nThe child’s U.S. citizen parent or U.S. citizen grandparent meets certain physical presence requirements in the United States or an outlying possession;\nThe child is under 18 years of age;\nThe child is residing outside of the United States in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent, or of a person who does not object to the application if the U.S. citizen parent is deceased; and\nThe child is lawfully admitted, physically present, and maintaining a lawful status in the United States at the time the application is approved and the time of naturalization.\nNote: Children of U.S. citizen military members residing outside the United States may complete the entire process from abroad.
