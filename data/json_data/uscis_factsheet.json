We will review the marriage bona fides, and \nif we determine the marriage was entered into in good faith, and you meet the eligibility threshold, we will \nremove the conditions on your permanent resident status. Removing these conditions will allow you to continue on your immigration journey toward naturalization.\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A JOINT SPOUSE FILING AND A WAIVER? \nYou may file a joint Form I-751  if:\n• You are still married to the same U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (petitioning spouse).\n• You are a child and cannot be included on your parent’s Form I-751 and your parent is still married to their petitioning spouse.\nThere may be instances where you are unable to file a joint petition, including:\n• Your spouse (or stepparent) is deceased; \n• You (or your parent) have divorced or annulled the marriage, but the marriage was entered into in good faith;\n• You (or your parent) entered into a good faith marriage, but you were battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by the U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse; or \n• The termination of your status and removal would result in extreme hardship. \nFor additional information see USCIS Fact Sheet: Family-Based Conditional Permanent Resident \nIndividual and Waiver Filing Requests .\n\nwww.uscis.gov\nToll free 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833)WHEN SHOULD I FILE MY I-751?\nYou must file to remove the conditions 90 days before your conditional Permanent Resident Card (Green \nCard) expires, by filing Form I-751. If you are filing your petition jointly with your spouse, you cannot file \nmore than 90 days before your card expires. You can find the Filing Date Calculator on the When to File Your \nPetition to Remove Conditions  page. You can file a Form I-751 waiver request at any time before a final \norder of exclusion, deportation or removal. For more information see the USCIS Fact Sheet: Family-Based \nConditional Permanent Resident - Individual and Waiver Filing Requests . \nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO FILE MY I-751?\nYou can find the filing fee for Form I-751 on our  Fee Schedule  page. If you are unable to pay the fee, you may \nbe eligible for a fee waiver. You can find additional information on filing a fee waiver by visiting our I -912, \nRequest for Fee Waiver page. \nWHEN DOES A CONDITIONAL PERMANENT RESIDENT CHILD NEED TO FILE A \nSEPARATE I-751 APPLICATION?\nA conditional permanent resident (CPR) child can be included on your I-751 application if the child obtained \nCPR status on the same day as you obtained CPR status, or within 90 days after. A CPR child needing to file \na separate form can do so at any time, even before the 90-day period before the second anniversary of \nobtaining CPR status, as long as the child is not subject to a final order of removal. Examples for individual filing include:\n• A child who obtained CPR status more than 90 days after the CPR parent;\n• The CPR parent died before filing the Form I-751; or\n• Any other circumstances preventing the child from being included in the Form I-751 of the parent or stepparent.\nIf your child is filing a separate Form I-751, you should fill out Part 5 on your Form I-751 about each of your children and answer “no” to the question “Is your child applying with you?” for children filing separately.\nWHAT IF THE U.S. CITIZEN (OR PERMANENT RESIDENT) SPOUSE DIED WHILE \nTHE FORM I-751 WAS PENDING? \nIf you entered the qualifying marriage in good faith, but are now a widow or widower, both you and your CPR \nchildren can amend pending I-751 petitions to an individual filing request. You must provide a copy of the \ncivilly registered death certificate and an English translation by a certified translator if the document is in any \nlanguage other than English.\n\nwww.uscis.gov\nToll free 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833)WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DERIVATIVE CHILDREN IF THE CONDITIONAL \nPERMANENT RESIDENT PARENT DIED BEFORE THEY WERE ELIGIBLE TO FILE THE I-751?\nIf the stepparent is willing to file the Form I-751 as a joint filing, they are still eligible to file together. The \nderivative child may also file a waiver on the Form I-751 without the stepparent if they are eligible for the \nwaiver being requested.\nWHAT IF I WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CPR WHEN I ENTERED THE UNITED STATES \nOR ADJUSTED STATUS EVEN THOUGH MY MARRIAGE WAS MORE THAN 2 \nYEARS AGO?\nIf you were married for more than 2 years at the time you entered the U.S. or adjusted status and you (or \nyour child) were granted conditional legal permanent resident status, you may have been misclassified. If \nyou believe that you or your children were misclassified as conditional legal permanent residents due to a \nDHS error, you should file an Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card ( Form I-90 ) according to the \nform instructions and the G-1055, Fee  Schedule . If you have already filed Form I-751, and you were admitted \nor adjusted based upon a marriage that occurred more than 2 years before that admission or adjustment of status, USCIS will update the class of admission code when the I-751 is adjudicated. \nWHAT IF THE U.S. CITIZEN (OR PERMANENT RESIDENT) PETITIONER AND THE \nNON-CITIZEN SPOUSE ARE SEPARATED OR FILE FOR DIVORCE?\nThe I-751 can continue to be a jointly filed petition and we will continue to process the petition until the \nmarriage is legally terminated through annulment or divorce, or the U.S. citizen or LPR petitioner withdraws \nsupport. If we become aware a marriage has been terminated, we may send a Request for Evidence for \ndocumentation of the final divorce decree or annulment. Once a marriage is terminated, you should notify USCIS. We can no longer process the I-751 as a joint filing; however, we may provide you with an opportunity \nto amend your filing to an individual filing. \nWHAT ARE THE SPECIAL FILING PERIODS FOR U.S. MILITARY MEMBERS WHO \nARE DEPLOYED AND FOR U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES WORKING \nABROAD?\nIf the CPR, petitioning spouse or stepparent is stationed or deployed overseas as a result of official military or \ngovernment orders, the requisite 90-day filing window before the 2-year anniversary of obtaining CPR status \ndoes not begin until the individual on official orders returns to the United States or is no longer on active \nduty. However, you may file the Form I-751 during the active-duty service or official order period, or after the 90-day period starts, and USCIS may waive the interview deadline or the requirement for an interview \nafter reviewing the evidence submitted, the nature of deployment, and bona fides of the marriage. If you file \nForm I-751 while overseas on U.S. military or U.S. federal government orders, you can complete the biometric requirements by submitting a properly completed FD-258 fingerprint card and 2 passport photographs.\n\nwww.uscis.gov\nToll free 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833)WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON’T FILE TO REMOVE THE CONDITIONS BEFORE MY \nGREEN CARD EXPIRES?\n• The general filing requirement for Form I-751 is to file within the 90-day period immediately before the \nsecond anniversary of having obtained permanent resident status.\n• If you do not file a Form I-751, this could result in the automatic termination of your permanent resident status in the United States. However, certain CPRs may be eligible for naturalization without filing a \npetition or having the conditions removed if applying on the basis of marriage to a U.S. citizen employed \nabroad, or qualifying military service. See www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/ volume-12-part-g-chapter-5  \n• If your failure to file was through no fault of your own, you may file your petition late with a written explanation and request that USCIS excuse the late filing, providing you don’t have a final order of \nremoval. We may excuse the failure to file before the expiration date if you demonstrate when you file \nthe petition that the delay was due to good cause and extenuating circumstances.\nHOW CAN I CONTACT USCIS ABOUT MY PENDING I-751 IF I NEED TO SUBMIT \nEVIDENCE OR AMEND MY FILING TO AN INDIVIDUAL FILING OR WAIVER \nREQUEST? \nFilers of an I-751 can create an account in myUSCIS  on the sign-up  webpage . Even if you filed your form \nthrough the mail, you can link your receipt number to your myUSCIS account. \nIf you have an online-filed case number (beginning with “IOE”) or have linked your case, the myUSCIS account \nallows you to:\n• Submit signed amendment requests, including waivers (amendments and waivers can also be made during an interview);\n• Upload responses to Requests for Evidence (RFE);\n• Upload documents; and\n• View your case status and history.\nIf your case begins with anything other than “IOE,” you can create a myUSCIS account and link your \ncase or send correspondence to the USCIS office that issued the receipt notice or the most recent I-751 \ncorrespondence.\nFor further assistance you may request an appointment  online or you may call the Contact Center at 800-\n375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833, VRS 877-709-5797) to request an in-person appointment.For information about filing Form I-751 visit the I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence webpage.",

You can find the final rule at: https://www.federalregister.gov/\ndocuments/2024/01/31/2024-01427/us-citizenship- and-immigration-services-fee-schedule-and-changes-\nto-certain-other- immigration .  \nThe new fees went into effect on April 1, 2024. \nThis document outlines the changes in fees, eligibility for fee waivers, and reduced fees for Form N-400, \nApplication for Naturalization.\nWhat are the new fees for Form N-400? \nThe fees depend on the method of filing, whether online or on paper. There is a $50 discount for filing online. \nForm N-400 Filing Method Previous Fee Current Fee\nOnline Filing:  Form N-400, Application for \nNaturalization$725 $710\nPaper Filing:  Form N-400, Application for \nNaturalization $725 $760\nApplications for service members of the \nU.S. armed forces $0 $0\nThere is no separate fee for biometric services. \nWhat are the new fee reduction guidelines? \nUSCIS has increased the federal poverty guidelines (FPG) income level for reduced fees. Naturalization \napplicants filing Form N-400 who have incomes between 150% and 400% of the FPG will pay $380, which is \nhalf the full fee. Previous regulations provided the half-price fee for N-400 applicants whose incomes were \nbetween 150% and 200% of the FPG. See the Poverty Guidelines webpage for additional information at \nwww.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees /poverty-guidelines . \nThe Department of Health and Human Services issues poverty guidelines in late January of each year.\nForm N-400s with reduced fee requests must be filed using paper Form N-400s with Part 10 of Form N-400 \ncompleted.

Therefore, applicants should not submit any fee \nwith the Form N-400 when requesting a fee waiver. If USCIS receives payment with a fee waiver request, the \npayment will be processed, and the fee waiver request will not.\nFee waiver requests must be filed on either with paper Form I-912s or with a written request attached to \nForm N-400.  \nSee below for an example of eligible income based on household size for a family of four living in \nWashington, D.C.: \nHousehold Size for Incomes \nup to 150% of the FPG2024 Dollar Amount Form N-400 Fee \nHousehold of 1 $0 to $22,590 $0\nHousehold of 4 $0 to $46,800 $0\nFor more information, visit https://www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees/ frequently-asked-questions-on-\nthe-uscis-fee-rule  and https:// www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees/additional-information-on-filing-a-fee-\nwaiver .",

In  FY  2023, USCIS  completed  more than  \n1,043,000 cases and reduced  the  backlog by more than  50 percent to approximately 414,350 cases. Because  processing times  are  calculated from  receipt date to\ncompletion  date,  when older cases  are completed,  processing times increase. \nNote(s): \n1)  Processing times may differ from previously published  reports  due  to system  updates  and post -adjudicative outcomes. \n2)  Processing times are defined  as  the  number of months  it took  for an  application, petition, or request  to be processed  from  receipt to completion  in a  given  \ntime period . Visa regressed  I-485s  and  revoked  petitions or applications are  excluded. Additional information  on  visa retrogression  can  be  found  on  our website . \n3)  Historical  processing times  are not comparable to the processing times posted  on  the USCIS processing times webpage for  certain form types  due to different \nmethodologies  (for example, cycle  time methodology versus processing time  methodology). For more information, visit  the  Case Processing Times  webpage . \n4) The federal  fiscal  year is  from October 1st through  September 30th. \nSource(s): 1)  Department of  Homeland  Security,  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  USCIS Electronic Immigration  System  (ELIS),  C3  Consolidated, C4 Consolidated,\nINFACT, queried February 2024.   \n \nP2",
