      "content": "H-2A Temporary Agricultural Workers\nAlert Type info\nALERT:\nUSCIS will process H-1B, H-2A, and H-2B related\nForm I-129\npetitions and CW-1 related\nForm I-129CW\npetitions during the government shutdown. We recognize, however, that the shutdown may affect a petitioner’s ability to get required documentation (such as a labor condition application or a temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor), which may delay their ability to file Form I-129 or Form I-129CW.\nIf an H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, or CW-1 petitioner meets all other applicable requirements and submits evidence establishing that the primary reason they did not timely file an extension of stay or change of status request was due to the government shutdown, we will consider the government shutdown an extraordinary circumstance beyond the petitioner’s control when we determine whether to excuse their failure to timely file the extension of stay or change of status request. We will monitor the situation closely and publish additional guidance if needed. Find additional information in\nVol. 2, Part  A, Chapter 4\nof the USCIS Policy Manual.\nAlert Type info\nALERT:\nUSCIS has\nannounced\na final rule, effective Oct. 2, 2025, to streamline the filing process for H-2A petitioners seeking unnamed beneficiaries. Beginning Oct. 2, these petitioners can electronically submit a new form, Form I-129H2A, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker: H-2A Classification, after the application for a temporary labor certification (TLC) is accepted by the Department of Labor (DOL) but before DOL approves the TLC. USCIS does not approve any petitions until after DOL has approved the corresponding TLC. The procedural change in this rule does not apply to H-2A petitions with named beneficiaries or to H-2A petitioners who file by paper. They must continue to use Form I-129.\nNote: Form I-129H2A can only be filed online by uploading the completed PDF in a\nUSCIS online account\n. USCIS will reject any paper filed Form I-129H2A petitions. At this time, we are only accepting Form I-129H2A for petitioners seeking unnamed beneficiaries filing without Form G-28. If you are filing an H-2A petition for named beneficiaries or filing with Form G-28, you must continue to file\nForm I-129\nby paper. In the coming weeks, we will expand availability of Form I-129H2A to H-2A petitioners seeking named beneficiaries or filing with Form G-28.\nThe H-2A program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, a U.S. agent as described in the regulations, or an association of U.S. agricultural producers named as a joint employer, must file\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\n, on a prospective worker’s behalf.\nWho May Qualify for H-2A Classification?\nTo qualify for H-2A nonimmigrant classification, the petitioner must:\nOffer a job that is of a temporary or seasonal nature.\nDemonstrate that there are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work.\nShow that employing H-2A workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\nGenerally, submit evidence of a single valid temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor with the H-2A petition. A petitioner electronically filing for unnamed beneficiaries using Form I-129H2A does not need to submit evidence of the valid TLC at the time of filing. (An additional limited exception to this requirement exists in certain “emergent circumstances.” See e.g., 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(x) for specific details.)\n*NOTE: As of Jan. 17, 2025, DHS regulations no longer require USCIS to consider whether the beneficiary is a national of a country that the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, has designated as eligible to participate in the H-2A program.\nH-2A Program Process for Paper Filed Petitions and/or Petitions Requesting Named Beneficiaries\nStep 1\n: Petitioner submits temporary labor certification (TLC) application to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).\nBefore requesting H-2A classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for and receive an approved TLC for H-2A workers from DOL. For further information regarding the TLC requirements and process, see the\nForeign Labor Certification, Department of Labor Web page\n.\nStep 2\n: Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS\n. After receiving an approved TLC for H-2A employment from DOL, the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit the original TLC as initial evidence with Form I-129. (See the instructions to Form I-129 for additional filing requirements.)\nStep 3\n: Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission\n. After USCIS approves Form I-129, prospective H-2A workers who are outside the United States must:\nApply for an H-2A visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or\nDirectly seek admission to the United States in H-2A classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry, if a worker does not require a visa in cases where an H-2A visa is not required.\nH-2A Program Process for Electronically Filed Petitions Requesting Unnamed Beneficiaries\nStep 1\n: Petitioner submits temporary labor certification (TLC) application to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).\nBefore requesting H-2A classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for a TLC for H-2A workers from DOL. For further information regarding the TLC requirements and process, see the\nForeign Labor Certification, Department of Labor Web page\n.\nStep 2\n: Petitioner submits Form I-129H2A to USCIS\n. The petitioner may file Form I-129H2A with USCIS upon receiving a Notice of Acceptance from DOL* or may choose to wait until the underlying TLC has been approved before electronically filing their H-2A petition. (See the instructions to Form I-129H2A for additional filing requirements.) However, even in cases where the petitioner files the H-2A petition after DOL acceptance and before approval, the TLC must be approved before USCIS completes the adjudication of the H-2A petition.\nStep 3\n: Prospective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission\n. After USCIS approves Form I-129H2A, prospective H-2A workers who are outside the United States must:\nApply for an H-2A visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or\nDirectly seek admission to the United States in H-2A classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry, if a worker does not require a visa in cases where an H-2A visa is not required.\n*NOTE\n: If you are filing an H-2A petition for unnamed beneficiaries after receiving a Notice of Acceptance but before approval of the TLC, USCIS will make necessary modifications to such petitions to reflect any modifications made by DOL and will ensure that no H-2A petition is approved before DOL approves the TLC.\nEffect of Prior Violation Determinations\nUnder new H-2 regulations in effect on January 17, 2025, USCIS has the authority to deny H-2A petitions filed on or after January 17, 2025, if the petitioner or its predecessor has been found to have committed certain serious labor law violations or otherwise violated the requirements of the H-2A or H-2B program.  Prospective denials under this provision will apply across both H-2 classifications regardless of whether the violation occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program. Whether the denial is mandatory or discretionary will depend on the nature of the past violation(s). For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nFor the purposes of this denial authority, a criminal conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against certain individuals will be treated as a conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against the petitioner or successor in interest. For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv)(C).\nIn addition, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C) with respect to how USCIS determines whether an employer is a successor in interest.\nProhibition on Collection of Fees Related to H-2A Employment\nAs a condition of approval of an H-2A petition, no job placement fee, fee or penalty for breach of contract, or other fee, penalty, or compensation (either direct or indirect) related to the H-2A employment (collectively, “prohibited fees”) may be collected at any time from a beneficiary of an H-2A or any person acting on the beneficiary’s behalf.\nProhibited fees may include, but are not limited to, deduction or withholding of wages or salary, whether or not such deduction or withholding of wages or salary provides some benefit to the beneficiary. Passing a cost to the beneficiary that, by statute or applicable regulations is the responsibility of the petitioner, constitutes the collection of a prohibited fee. For additional information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nUSCIS will deny or revoke the petition if we determine that the petitioner or any petitioner’s employee, agent, attorney, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service, or any employer or joint employer, collected, or entered into an agreement to collect, prohibited fees, as described above, whether before or after the filing of the petition. For information about the limited exceptions to a mandatory denial or revocation for prohibited fees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nIf a petition is denied or revoked for prohibited fees, or if the petitioner withdraws the petition after USCIS issued a notice of intent to deny or revoke on this basis, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files within 1 year after the decision or acknowledgment of withdrawal if the denied or revoked petition was filed on or after January 17, 2025. After that 1-year period, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files for an additional 3 years\nunless\neach affected beneficiary, or their designee as appropriate, has been reimbursed in full. Denial on this basis will apply to petitions for both the H-2A and H-2B classifications regardless of whether the denial, revocation, or withdrawal occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program. The 3-year denial period will apply to petitioners whose petitions were previously denied, revoked, or withdrawn after being filed on or after January 17, 2025.  For additional information, including regarding successor in interest determinations and reimbursement of designees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nPeriod of Stay\nGenerally, USCIS may grant H-2A classification for up to the period of time authorized on the temporary labor certification (TLC). H-2A classification may be extended for qualifying employment in increments of up to 1 year each. A new, valid TLC covering the requested time must accompany each extension request. The maximum period of stay in H-2A classification is 3 years.\nA person who has held H-2A nonimmigrant status for a total of 3 years must depart and remain outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days before seeking readmission as an H-2A nonimmigrant. Additionally, previous time spent in other H or L classifications counts toward total H-2A time.\n“Resetting” the 3-year limit\nA qualifying absence from the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days at any time will result in the H-2A worker becoming eligible for a new 3-year maximum period of H-2A stay. Brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure during the required time abroad are not considered to be interruptive, but do not count towards fulfillment of the required 60-day minimum period of time abroad.\nTo qualify, the petitioner must provide evidence documenting the worker’s relevant absence(s) from the United States, such as, but not limited to, arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad.\nA petitioner may choose to file a separate petition on behalf of the worker(s) for whom it is providing evidence of qualifying absences to reset the 3-year limit. While not required, filing separate petitions may help decrease delays in processing if USCIS requests additional evidence, and may help avoid a shortened validity period for other workers if one or more workers will reach the 3-year maximum period of stay during the requested validity period and USCIS is unable to verify the claimed period(s) of absence.\nFiling Multiple Petitions\nYou generally may file one petition to request all of your H-2A workers associated with one temporary labor certification (with a limit of 25 named workers per petition). If you are required to file more than one petition (for instance if you are filing on behalf of both named and unnamed workers) or if you choose to file more than one petition:\nThe total number of beneficiaries on your petitions may not exceed the total number of workers approved by the U.S. Department of Labor on the temporary labor certification;\nEach petition must be accompanied by a copy of the same temporary labor certification; and\nPlease include an attachment noting that you are filing other petitions based on the same temporary labor certification.\nFamily of H-2A Workers\nAn H-2A worker’s spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Family members are not eligible for employment in the United States while in H-4 status.\nEmployment-Related Notifications to USCIS\nOMB Control Number 1615-0107\nPetitioners of H-2A workers must notify USCIS within 2 workdays if any of the following occur:\nWorker Never Reported for Work\n: The H-2A worker does not report for work within 5 work days of the latter of:\nThe employment start date on the H-2A petition, or\nThe start date established by the employer;\nWorker Stopped Reporting for Work:\nThe H-2A worker leaves without notice and does not report for work for 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer;\nTermination:\nThe H-2A worker is terminated before completing the H-2A labor or services for which he or she was hired; or\nEarly Completion:\nThe H-2A worker finishes the labor or services for which he or she was hired more than 30 days earlier than the end date specified in the H-2A petition.\nNote\n: USCIS defers to DOL’s definition of “workday.” According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), this generally means the period of time on any particular day when an employee begins and ends his or her “principal activities.”\nPetitioners must include the following information on the employment-related notification:\nThe reason for the notification (for example, explain that the worker never reported for work,” or “stopped reporting for work,” or that the employment ended in “termination,” or “early completion”);\nThe reason for untimely notification and evidence for good cause, if applicable;\nThe USCIS receipt number of the approved H-2A petition;\nThe petitioner’s information, including:\nName\nAddress\nPhone number\nEmployer identification number (EIN)\nThe employer’s information (if different from that of the petitioner):\nName\nAddress\nPhone number\nThe H-2A worker’s information:\nFull Name\nDate of birth\nPlace of birth\nLast known physical address and phone number\nAdditionally, to help USCIS identify the H-2A worker, submit the following for each H-2A worker, if available:\nSocial Security number\nVisa number\nFailure to Notify USCIS:\nA petitioner who fails to comply with these employment notification requirements, or fails to demonstrate good cause for untimely notification, may be required to pay $10 in liquidated damages for each instance of noncompliance.\nNote:\nThe employment notification requirement is a petitioner obligation and does not represent an indication of wrongdoing on the part of the H-2A worker. Further, USCIS does not consider the information provided in a petitioner notification, standing alone, to be conclusive evidence regarding the worker’s current status.\nHow do I notify USCIS?\nEmail or mail your notification to the California Service Center at the following addresses. Although not required, email notification is strongly recommended to ensure timely notification.\nCalifornia Service Center\nBy email:\nCSC-X.H-2AAbs@uscis.dhs.gov\nBy mail:\nUSCIS California Service Center\nP.O. Box 30113 / ALL OTHER (Attn: BCU Section)\nTustin, CA 92781\nInquiring About a Pending H-2A Petition\nUSCIS provides expedited processing of Form I-129 for H-2A petitions. You can check the status of your case using\nCase Status Online\n. If your petition has been pending for more than 15 days and we have not sent you a decision or request for more evidence, you may call the\nUSCIS Contact Center\nat\n800-375-5283\nto ask about the status of your case.\nNote: We can only provide case-specific information to authorized individuals (for example, petitioners and attorneys of record). For H-2A petitions, the petitioner is the petitioning individual or company. We cannot provide case-specific information to unauthorized third parties, such as the beneficiary (the temporary worker).\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n10/01/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

We recognize, however, that the shutdown may affect a petitioner’s ability to get required documentation (such as a labor condition application or a temporary labor certification from the U.S. Department of Labor), which may delay their ability to file Form I-129 or Form I-129CW.\nIf an H-1B, H-2A, H-2B, or CW-1 petitioner meets all other applicable requirements and submits evidence establishing that the primary reason they did not timely file an extension of stay or change of status request was due to the government shutdown, we will consider the government shutdown an extraordinary circumstance beyond the petitioner’s control when we determine whether to excuse their failure to timely file the extension of stay or change of status request. We will monitor the situation closely and publish additional guidance if needed. Find additional information in\nVol. 2, Part  A, Chapter 4\nof the USCIS Policy Manual.\nThe H-2B program allows U.S. employers or U.S. agents who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs. A U.S. employer, or U.S. employer, or U.S. agent as described in the regulations, must file\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\n, on a prospective worker’s behalf.\nWho May Qualify for H-2B Classification?\nTo qualify for H-2B nonimmigrant classification, the petitioner must establish that:\nThere are not enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work.\nEmploying H-2B workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\nIts need for the prospective worker’s services or labor is temporary, regardless of whether the underlying job can be described as temporary. The employer’s need is considered temporary if it is a(n):\nOne-time occurrence –\nA petitioner claiming a one-time occurrence must show that it has:\nAn employment situation that is otherwise permanent, but a temporary event of short duration has created the need for a temporary worker.\nNot employed workers to perform the service or labor in the past, and will not need workers to perform the services or labor in the future;\nOR\nSeasonal need –\nA petitioner claiming a seasonal need must show that the service or labor for which it seeks workers is:\nTraditionally tied to a season of the year by an event or pattern; and\nOf a recurring nature.\nNote: You cannot claim a seasonal need if the time period when you do NOT need the service or labor is:\nUnpredictable;\nSubject to change; or\nConsidered a vacation period for your permanent employees.\nOR\nPeak load need\n– A petitioner claiming a peak load need must show that it:\nRegularly employs permanent workers to perform the services or labor at the place of employment;\nNeeds to temporarily supplement its permanent staff at the place of employment due to a seasonal or short-term demand; and\nThe temporary additions to staff will not become part of the employer's regular operation.\nOR\nIntermittent need\n– A petitioner claiming an intermittent need must show that it:\nHas not employed permanent or full-time workers to perform the services or labor; and\nOccasionally or intermittently needs temporary workers to perform services or labor for short periods.\nH-2B petitioners must also provide a single valid temporary labor certification from the\nU.S. Department of Labor (DOL),\nor, if the workers will be employed on Guam, from the\nGuam Department of Labor (Guam DOL).\n*NOTE: As of Jan. 17, 2025, DHS regulations no longer require USCIS to consider whether the beneficiary is a national of a country that the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, has designated as eligible to participate in the H-2B program.\nH-2B Cap\nThere is a statutory numerical limit, or \"cap,\" on the total number of aliens who may be issued an H-2B visa or otherwise granted H-2B status during a fiscal year. Currently, Congress has set the H-2B cap at 66,000 per fiscal year, with 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the first half of the fiscal year (October 1 - March 31) and 33,000 for workers who begin employment in the second half of the fiscal year (April 1 - September 30). Any unused numbers from the first half of the fiscal year will be available for employers seeking to hire H-2B workers during the second half of the fiscal year. However, unused H-2B numbers from one fiscal year do not carry over into the next.\nOnce the H-2B cap is reached, USCIS may only accept petitions for H-2B workers who are exempt from the H-2B cap.  For additional information on the current H-2B cap, and on workers who are exempt from it, see the\nCap Count for H-2B Nonimmigrants Web page\n.\nH-2B Program Process\nStep 1\n: Petitioner submits temporary labor certification application to DOL.\nBefore requesting H-2B classification from USCIS, the petitioner must apply for and receive a temporary labor certification for H-2B workers with the U.S. Department of Labor (or Guam DOL if the employment will be in Guam).* For further information regarding the temporary labor certification application requirements and process, see the\nForeign Labor Certification, Department of Labor\nand\nForeign Labor Certification, Guam Department of Labor\nWeb pages.\nStep 2\n: Petitioner submits Form I-129 to USCIS.\nAfter receiving a temporary labor certification for H-2B employment from either DOL or Guam DOL (if applicable), the petitioner must file Form I-129 with USCIS. With limited exceptions, the petitioner must submit the original temporary labor certification with Form I-129 (See the Form I-129 instructions for additional filing requirements). If the application for a temporary labor certification was processed in DOL’s FLAG system, the petitioner must include a printed copy of the electronic one-page “final determination” of the H-2B temporary labor certification approval with Form I-129. USCIS will consider a printed copy of the final determination as the original and approved temporary labor certification. If a petitioner has already submitted the original temporary labor certification with a previous Form I-129, submit a copy of the temporary labor certification and provide an explanation that includes the receipt number of the petition with which the original was filed, if available.\nStep 3:\nProspective workers outside the United States apply for visa and/or admission.\nAfter USCIS approved Form I-129, prospective H-2B workers who are outside the United States must:\nApply for an H-2B visa with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad and then seek admission to the United States with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at a U.S. port of entry; or\nDirectly seek admission to the United States in H-2B classification with CBP at a U.S. port of entry in cases where an H-2B visa is not required.\n*Note: If you are petitioning for one or more Canadian musicians that will be employed within a 50 mile radius from the U.S.-Canadian border for 30 days or less, you may skip Step 1 in the H-2B process.\nReporting H-2B Fraud\nAnyone (including American workers and H-2B workers who suspect they or others may be the victim of H-2B fraud or abuse) can send us tips, alleged violations, and other relevant information about potential fraud or abuse using our\nonline tip form\n.\nEffect of Prior Violation Determinations\nUnder the new regulations in effect on January 17, 2025, USCIS has the authority to deny H-2B petitions filed on or after January 17, 2025, if the petitioner or its predecessor has been found to have committed certain serious labor law violations or otherwise violated the requirements of the H-2A or H-2B program.  Prospective denials under this provision will apply across both H-2 classifications regardless of whether the violation occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program. Whether the denial is mandatory or discretionary will depend on the nature of the past violation(s). For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nFor the purposes of this denial authority, a criminal conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against certain individuals will be treated as a conviction or final administrative or judicial determination against the petitioner or successor in interest. For more information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv)(C).\nIn addition, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(D) with respect to how USCIS determines whether an employer is a successor in interest.\nProhibition on Collection of Fees Related to H-2B Employment\nAs a condition of approval of an H-2B petition, no job placement fee, fee or penalty for breach of contract, or other fee, penalty, or compensation (either direct or indirect) related to the H-2B employment (collectively, “prohibited fees”) may be collected at any time from a beneficiary of an H-2B or any person acting on the beneficiary’s behalf.\nProhibited fees may include, but are not limited to, deduction or withholding of wages or salary, whether or not such deduction or withholding of wages or salary provides some benefit to the beneficiary. Passing a cost to the beneficiary that, by statute or applicable regulations is the responsibility of the petitioner, constitutes the collection of a prohibited fee. For additional information, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B)-(D) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nUSCIS will deny or revoke the petition if we determine that the petitioner or any petitioner’s employee, agent, attorney, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service, or any employer or joint employer, collected, or entered into an agreement to collect, prohibited fees, as described above, whether before or after the filing of the petition. For information about the limited exceptions to a mandatory denial or revocation for prohibited fees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B)-(D) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nIf USCIS denies or revokes a petition for prohibited fees, or if the petitioner withdraws the petition after USCIS issued a notice of intent to deny or revoke on this basis, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files within 1 year after the decision or acknowledgment of withdrawal if the denied or revoked petition was filed on or after January 17, 2025.  After that 1-year period, USCIS will deny any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files for an additional 3 years unless each affected beneficiary, or their designee as appropriate, has been reimbursed in full.  Denial on this basis will apply to petitions for both the H-2A and H-2B classifications regardless of whether the denial, revocation, or withdrawal occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program. The 3-year denial period will apply to petitioners whose petitions were previously denied, revoked, or withdrawn after being filed on or after January 17, 2025. For additional information, including regarding successor in interest determinations and reimbursement of designees, see 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(B)-(D) and the Form I-129 Instructions.\nPeriod of Stay\nGenerally, USCIS may grant H-2B classification for up to the period of time authorized on the temporary labor certification. H-2B classification may be extended for qualifying employment in increments of up to 1 year each. A new, valid temporary labor certification covering the requested time must accompany each extension request. The maximum period of stay in H-2B classification is 3 years.\nA person who has held H-2B nonimmigrant status for a total of 3 years must depart and remain outside the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days before seeking readmission as an H-2B nonimmigrant. Additionally, previous time spent in other H or L classifications counts toward total H-2B time.\n“Resetting” the 3-year limit\nAn absence from the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days at any time will result in the H-2B worker becoming eligible for a new 3-year maximum period of H-2B stay. Brief trips to the United States for business or pleasure during the required time abroad are not considered to be interruptive, but do not count towards fulfillment of the required 60-day minimum period of time abroad.\nTo qualify, the petitioner must provide evidence documenting the worker’s relevant absence(s) from the United States, such as, but not limited to, arrival and departure records, copies of tax returns, and records of employment abroad.\nFiling Multiple Petitions\nYou generally may file one petition to request all of your H-2B workers associated with one temporary labor certification (with a limit of 25 named workers per petition). If you are required to file more than one petition (for instance if you are filing on behalf of both named and unnamed workers) or if you choose to file more than one petition:\nThe total number of beneficiaries on your petitions may not exceed the total number of workers approved by the U.S. Department of Labor on the temporary labor certification;\nEach petition must be accompanied by a copy of the same temporary labor certification; and\nPlease include an attachment noting that you are filing other petitions based on the same temporary labor certification.\nFamily of H-2B Workers\nAny H-2B worker's spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age may seek admission in H-4 nonimmigrant classification. Family members are not eligible for employment in the United States while in H-4 status.\nEmployment-Related Notifications to USCIS\nOMB Control Number 1615-0107\nPetitioners of H-2B workers must notify USCIS within 2 workdays if any of the following occur:\nWorker Never Reported for Work\n: The H-2B worker does not report for work within 5 work days of the employment start date on the H-2B petition;\nWorker Stopped Reporting for Work:\nThe H-2B worker leaves without notice and does not report for work for a period of 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer;\nTermination:\nThe H-2B worker is terminated before completing the H-2B labor or services for which he or she was hired; or\nEarly Completion:\nThe H-2B worker finishes the labor or services for which he or she was hired more than 30 days earlier than the end date specified in the H-2B petition.\nNote\n: USCIS defers to DOL’s definition of “workday.” According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), this generally means the period of time on any particular day when an employee begins and ends his or her “principal activities.”\nPetitioners must include the following information in the employment-related notification:\nThe reason for the notification (for example, explain that the worker “never reported for work,” or “stopped reporting for work,” or that the employment ended in “termination,” or “early completion\");\nThe reason for untimely notification and evidence for good cause, if applicable;\nThe USCIS receipt number of the approved H-2B petition;\nThe petitioner’s information, including:\nName\nAddress\nPhone number\nEmployer identification number (EIN)\nThe employer’s information (if different from that of the petitioner):\nName\nAddress\nPhone number\nThe H-2B worker’s information:\nFull Name\nDate of birth\nPlace of birth\nLast known physical address and phone number\nAdditionally, to help USCIS identify the H-2B worker, submit the following for each H-2B worker, if available:\nSocial Security number, and\nVisa number\nNote:\nThe employment notification requirement is a petitioner obligation and does not represent an indication of wrongdoing on the part of the H-2B worker. Further, USCIS does not consider the information provided in a petitioner notification, standing alone, to be conclusive evidence regarding the worker’s current status.\nHow do I notify USCIS?\nEmail or mail your notification to the USCIS Service Center that approved the I-129 petition. Although not required, email notification is strongly recommended to ensure timely notification.\nCalifornia Service Center\nBy email:\nCSC-X.H-2BAbs@uscis.dhs.gov\nBy mail:\nUSCIS California Service Center\nP.O.

      "content": "L-1A Intracompany Transferee Executive or Manager\nThe L-1A nonimmigrant classification enables a U.S. employer to transfer an executive or manager from one of its affiliated foreign offices to one of its offices in the United States. This classification also enables a foreign company that does not yet have an affiliated U.S. office to send an executive or manager to the United States with the purpose of establishing one. The employer must file a\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\n, with fee, on behalf of the employee.\nThe following information describes some of the features and requirements of the L-1 nonimmigrant visa program.\nGeneral Qualifications of the Employer and Employee\nTo qualify for L-1 classification in this category, the employer must:\nHave a qualifying relationship with a foreign company (parent company, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate, collectively referred to as\nqualifying organizations\n); and\nCurrently be, or will be,\ndoing business\nas an employer in the United States and in at least one other country directly or through a qualifying organization for the duration of the beneficiary’s stay in the United States as an L-1. While the business must be viable, there is no requirement that it be engaged in international trade.\nDoing business\nmeans the regular, systematic, and continuous provision of goods and/or services by a qualifying organization and does not include the mere presence of an agent or office of the qualifying organization in the United States and abroad.\nTo qualify, the named employee must also:\nGenerally have been working for a qualifying organization abroad for one continuous year within the three years immediately preceding his or her admission to the United States; and\nBe seeking to enter the United States to provide service in an\nexecutive\nor\nmanagerial capacity\nfor a branch of the same employer or one of its qualifying organizations.\nExecutive capacity\ngenerally refers to the employee’s ability to make decisions of wide latitude without much oversight.\nManagerial capacity\ngenerally refers to the ability of the employee to supervise and control the work of professional employees and to manage the organization, or a department, subdivision, function, or component of the organization. It may also refer to the employee’s ability to manage an essential function of the organization at a high level, without direct supervision of others. See section 101(a)(44) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and 8 CFR 214.2(l)(1)(ii) for complete definitions.\nNew Offices\nFor foreign employers seeking to send an employee to the United States as an executive or manager to establish a new office, the employer must also show that:\nThe employer has secured sufficient physical premises to house the new office;\nThe employee has been employed as an executive or manager for one continuous year in the three years preceding the filing of the petition; and\nThe intended U.S. office will support an executive or managerial position within one year of the approval of the petition.\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(l)(3)(v) for details.\nPeriod of Stay\nQualified employees entering the United States to establish a new office will be allowed a maximum initial stay of one year. All other qualified employees will be allowed a maximum initial stay of three years. For all L-1A employees, requests for extension of stay may be granted in increments of up to an additional two years, until the employee has reached the maximum limit of seven years.\nFamily of L-1 Workers\nThe transferring employee may be accompanied or followed by their spouse and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Spouses and children may seek admission in the L-2 nonimmigrant classification and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee.\nIf these family members are already in the United States and seeking changes of status to or extension of stay in L-2 classification, they may apply collectively, with fee, on an\nForm I-539, Application to Change/Extend Nonimmigrant Status\n.\nSpouses of L-1 workers in valid L-2S nonimmigrant status are considered employment authorized incident to status. DHS-issued evidence of such employment authorization that is acceptable for completion of Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, include:\nAn unexpired Form I-94 with a notation reflecting L-2S nonimmigrant status. As of Jan. 30, 2022, USCIS and CBP began issuing Forms I-94 with a new admission code for spouses of L-1 workers: L-2S. An unexpired Form I-94 reflecting this new code is acceptable as evidence of employment authorization for L spouses under List C of Form I-9;\nAn unexpired Form I-94 with a notation reflecting L-2 nonimmigrant status, together with a notice from USCIS regarding the new admission code. USCIS will send L spouses with a Form I-94 issued by USCIS before Jan. 30, 2022, that was notated with L-2 nonimmigrant status, a notice regarding the new admission code that, together with an unexpired Form I-94 reflecting L-2 nonimmigrant status, serves as evidence of employment authorization for such spouses under List C of Form I-9. For more information, see this\nweb alert\n;\nAn unexpired Employment Authorization Document (EAD). L spouses are not required to request employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, but may still file Form I-765, with fee, in order to obtain an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766 or EAD). EADs are acceptable evidence of both identity and employment authorization under List A of Form I-9; or\nA facially expired EAD with additional documentation to show the EAD is automatically extended. See our\nAutomatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\npage for more information on this automatic extension.\nForm I-129 Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants\nFrom April 30, 2018, to April 30, 2020, the California Service Center and the CBP Blaine, Washington, port of entry (POE) are participating in a joint agency pilot program for Canadian citizens seeking L-1 nonimmigrant status under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). For additional information, please visit the\nForm I-129/I-129S Pilot Program for Canadian L-1 Nonimmigrants\n.\nBlanket Petitions\nCertain organizations may establish the required intracompany relationship in advance of filing individual L-1 petitions by filing a blanket petition. Eligibility for blanket L certification may be established if:\nThe petitioner and each of the qualifying organizations are engaged in commercial trade or services;\nThe petitioner has an office in the United States that has been doing business for one year or more;\nThe petitioner has three or more domestic and foreign branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates; and\nThe petitioner along with the other qualifying organizations meet one of the following criteria:\nHave obtained at least 10 L-1 approvals during the previous 12-month period;\nHave U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates with combined annual sales of at least $25 million; or\nHave a U.S. work force of at least 1,000 employees.\nThe approval of a blanket L petition does not guarantee that an employee will be granted L-1A classification. It does, however, provide the employer with the flexibility to transfer eligible employees to the United States quickly and with short notice without having to file an individual petition with USCIS.\nWhere an L-1 visa is required\nIn most cases, once the blanket petition has been approved, the employer need only complete\nForm, I-129S,Nonimmigrant Petition Based on Blanket L Petition\n, and send it to the employee along with a copy of the blanket petition Approval Notice and other required evidence, so that the employee may present it to a consular officer in connection with an application for an L-1 visa.\nCanadians with an approved blanket petition seeking L-1 classification\nCanadian citizens, who are exempt from the L-1 visa requirement, may present the completed Form I-129S and supporting documentation to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer at certain ports-of-entry on the United States-Canada land border or at a United States pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station in Canada, in connection with an application for admission to the United States in L-1 status.\nPlease refer to\nCBP’s website\nfor additional information and/or requirements for applying for admission into the United States.\nOptional filing of Form I-129S with USCIS\nIf the prospective L-1 employee is visa-exempt, the employer may file the Form I-129S and supporting documentation with the USCIS service center that approved the blanket petition, instead of submitting the form and supporting documentation directly with CBP.\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(l)(4) and 8 CFR 214.2(l)(5) for more details regarding blanket petitions.\nMore Information\nFiling Multiple L-1 Intracompany Transferee Petitions Related to the Same Project\nFrequently Asked Questions about Part 6 of Form I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\nVIBE Program\nWork Authorization\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n07/29/2024\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "O-1 Visa: Individuals with Extraordinary Ability or Achievement\nThe O-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the individual who possesses extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics, or who has a demonstrated record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture or television industry and has been recognized nationally or internationally for those achievements.\nFor more information, see\nUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M\n.\nThe O nonimmigrant classification are commonly referred to as:\nO-1A: Individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry);\nO-1B: Individuals with an extraordinary ability in the arts or extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television industry;\nO-2: Individuals who will accompany an O-1 artist or athlete to assist in a specific event or performance; and\nO-3: Individuals who are the spouse or children of O-1 and O-2 visa holders.\nGeneral Eligibility\nTo qualify for an O-1 visa, you must demonstrate extraordinary ability by sustained national or international acclaim, or a record of extraordinary achievement in the motion picture and television industry, and must be coming temporarily to the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability.\nExtraordinary ability in the fields of science, education, business or athletics means a level of expertise indicating that you are one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the field. For detailed information regarding how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1A eligibility, including examples and considerations that are especially relevant for those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, see the\nUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 4, Section C\n, and\nAppendix: Satisfying the O-1A Evidentiary Requirements\n.\nExtraordinary ability in the field of arts means distinction. Distinction means a high level of achievement in the field of the arts. This is evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition substantially above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that you are prominent, renowned, leading, or well-known in the field of arts. For detailed information on how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1B eligibility, including examples and considerations, see\nUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter D\nand\nAppendix: Satisfying the O-1B Evidentiary Requirements\n.\nTo qualify for an O-1 visa in the motion picture or television industry, you must demonstrate extraordinary achievement. This is evidenced by a degree of skill and recognition significantly above that ordinarily encountered, to the extent that you are recognized as outstanding, notable or leading in the motion picture and/or television field. For detailed information on how USCIS evaluates evidence to determine O-1B eligibility, including examples and considerations, see\nUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter E\nand\nAppendix: Satisfying the O-1B Evidentiary Requirements\n.\nTo qualify for an O-2 visa, your assistance must be an “integral part” of the O-1A visa holder’s performance and you must have critical skills and experience with the O-1 visa holder that are not of a general nature and cannot be readily performed by a U.S. worker. In the case of an O-2 visa holder in the motion picture or television industry, you must have skills and experience with the O-1 visa holder that are not of a general nature and which are critical either based on a pre-existing longstanding working relationship or, with respect to the specific production, because significant production (including pre- and post-production work) will take place both inside and outside the United States and your continuing participation is essential to the successful completion of the production.\nApplication Process for an O-1 Visa\nA U.S. employer, U.S. agent, or foreign employer through a U.S. agent should file (see\nForm I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker\n) on your behalf, along with the required evidence according to the form instructions. Your employer or agent cannot file the petition more than one year before they actually need your services. To avoid delays, your employer or agent should file your Form I-129 at least 45 days before the date of employment.\nIn addition to Form I-129, the petitioner must submit the documentary evidence discussed below:\nConsultation\nThe Petitioner must provide a written advisory opinion from a peer group (including labor organizations) or a person with expertise in the beneficiary’s area of ability. If the O-1 petition is for an individual with extraordinary achievement in motion picture or television, the consultation must come from an appropriate labor union and a management organization with expertise in the beneficiary’s area of ability.\nWhen a consultation includes a watermark or other distinctive marks to confirm the authenticity of the document, petitioners should submit to USCIS the version containing the watermark or other distinctive marks. Copies of documents that do not contain the appropriate watermark or other distinctive marks may raise doubts about the authenticity of the document and may result in processing delays. For example, USCIS may request that the petitioner submit the original version of the document. To avoid processing delays, petitioners should ensure that they submit the appropriate version and that any associated watermark or other distinctive marks are legible.\nExceptions to the Consultation Requirement\nIf your employer or agent can demonstrate that an appropriate peer group, including a labor organization, does not exist, then we will base our decision on the evidence they submit in support of the Form I-129. We may waive a consultation if you have extraordinary ability in the field of arts and you are seeking readmission to perform similar services within two years of the date of a previous consultation. Your employer or agent should submit a waiver request and a copy of the previous consultation with the petition.\nFor more information on consultations for O nonimmigrants, see\nUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 7\n.\nContract between petitioner and beneficiary\nThe Petitioner must submit a copy of any written contract between you and the petitioner or a summary of the terms of the oral agreement under which you will be employed.\nFor additional information about the contract requirement for O-1 nonimmigrants, and considerations specific to agent petitioners, see\nUSCIS Policy Manual Volume 2, Part M, Chapter 7\n.\nItineraries\nThe petitioner must provide an explanation of the nature of the events or activities, the beginning and ending dates for the events or activities, and a copy of any itinerary for the events or activities, if applicable. The petitioner must establish that there are events or activities in your field of extraordinary ability for the validity period requested such as an itinerary for a tour or a series of events.\nAgents\nA U.S. agent may be your actual employer, the representative of both you and the employer, or a person or entity authorized by the employer to act for, or in place of, the employer as its agent.

      "content": "E-1 Treaty Traders\nThe E-1 nonimmigrant classification allows a national of a treaty country (a country with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation, or which the United States maintains a qualifying international agreement, or which has been deemed a qualifying country by legislation) to be admitted to the United States solely to engage in international trade on his or her own behalf. Certain employees of such a person or of a qualifying organization may also be eligible for this classification. (For dependent family members, see “Family of E-1 Treaty Traders and Employees” below.)\nSee\nU.S. Department of State's Treaty Countries\nfor a current list of countries with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation.\nWho May File for Change of Status to E-1 Classification\nIf the treaty trader is currently in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status, they may file Form I-129 to request a change of status to E-1 classification. If the desired employee is currently in the United States in a lawful nonimmigrant status, the qualifying employer may file Form I-129 on the employee’s behalf.\nHow to Obtain E-1 Classification if Outside the United States\nA request for E-1 classification may not be made on Form I-129 if you are physically outside the United States. Interested parties should refer to the U.S. Department of State website for further information about applying for an E-1 nonimmigrant visa abroad. Upon issuance of a visa, the person may seek admission at a United States port of entry as an E-1 nonimmigrant.\nGeneral Qualifications of a Treaty Trader\nTo qualify for E-1 classification, the treaty trader must:\nBe a national of a country with which the United States maintains a treaty of commerce and navigation or with which the United States maintains a qualifying international agreement, or which has been deemed a qualifying country by legislation;\nCarry on substantial trade; and\nCarry on principal trade between the United States and the treaty country which qualified the treaty trader for E-1 classification.\nTrade is the existing international exchange of items of trade for consideration between the United States and the treaty country. Items of trade include but are not limited to:\nGoods\nServices\nInternational banking\nInsurance\nTransportation\nTourism\nTechnology and its transfer\nSome news-gathering activities.\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(e)(9) for additional examples and discussion.\nSubstantial trade generally refers to an amount of trade sufficient to ensure a continuous flow of international trade items between the United States and the treaty country. The continuous flow contemplates numerous transactions over time. There is no minimum requirement regarding the monetary value or volume of each transaction. While monetary value of transactions is a relevant factor in considering substantiality, greater weight is given to more numerous exchanges of greater value. For smaller businesses, the income derived from the value of numerous transactions which is sufficient to support the treaty trader and their family is a favorable factor. See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(10) for further details.\nPrincipal trade between the United States and the treaty country exists when over 50% of the volume of international trade of the treaty trader is between the United States and the treaty country of the treaty trader’s nationality. See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(11).\nGeneral Qualifications of the Employee of a Treaty Trader\nTo qualify for E-1 classification, the employee of a treaty trader must:\nBe the same nationality of the principal alien employer (who must have the nationality of the treaty country)\nMeet the definition of “employee” under relevant law\nEither be engaging in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or if employed in a lesser capacity, have special qualifications that make the employee’s services essential to the efficient operation of the treaty enterprise.\nIf the principal alien employer is not an individual, it must be an enterprise or organization at least 50% owned by persons in the United States who have the nationality of the treaty country. These owners must either: (a) be maintaining nonimmigrant treaty trader status or (b) if the owners are not in the United States, they must be, if they were to seek admission to this country, classifiable as nonimmigrant treaty traders. See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(3)(ii).\nDuties which are of an executive or supervisory character are those that primarily provide the employee ultimate control and responsibility for the treaty enterprise’s overall operation, or a major component of it. See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(17) for a more complete definition.\nSpecial qualifications are skills and/or aptitudes which make the employee’s services essential to the efficient operation of the treaty enterprise. There are several qualities or circumstances that could, depending on the facts, meet this requirement. These include, but are not limited to:\nThe degree of proven expertise in the employee’s area of operations\nWhether others possess the employee’s specific skills\nThe salary that the special qualifications can command\nWhether the skills and qualifications are readily available in the United States\nKnowledge of a foreign language and culture does not, by itself, meet this requirement. Note that in some cases a skill that is essential at one point in time may become commonplace, and therefore no longer qualifying, at a later date. See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(18) for a more complete definition.\nPeriod of Stay\nQualified treaty traders and employees will be allowed a maximum initial stay of two years. Requests for extension of stay in, or changes of status to, E-1 classification may be granted in increments of up to two years each. There is no limit to the number of extensions an E-1 nonimmigrant may be granted. All E-1 nonimmigrants, however, must maintain an intention to depart the United States when their status expires or is terminated.\nAn E-1 nonimmigrant who travels abroad may generally be granted, if determined admissible by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Officer , an automatic two-year period of readmission when returning to the United States.\nTerms and Conditions of E-1 Status\nA treaty trader or employee may only work in the activity for which he or she was approved at the time the classification was granted. An E-1 employee, however, may also work for the treaty organization’s parent company or one of its subsidiaries as long as the:\nRelationship between the organizations is established;\nSubsidiary employment requires executive, supervisory, or essential skills; and\nTerms and conditions of employment have not otherwise changed.\nSee 8 CFR 214.2(e)(8)(ii) for details.\nUSCIS must approve any substantive change in the terms or conditions of E-1 status. A “substantive change” is defined as a fundamental change in the employer’s basic characteristics that would affect the alien’s eligibility for E classification, such as, but not limited to\na merger;\nAcquisition;\nsale of the division where the lien is employed; or\nother event that affects the treaty trader or employee’s previously approved relationship with the treaty enterprise.\nWhere there has been such a substantive change, the treaty trader or enterprise, if it wishes to continue to employ the alien in E-1 status, must notify USCIS by filing a new Form I-129 with fee, and may simultaneously request an extension of stay for the treaty trader or affected employee. The petition must include evidence to show that the treaty trader or affected employee continues to qualify for E-1 classification. An employer who no longer employs an E-1 nonimmigrant is urged to inform USCIS of this upon termination of the E-1 nonimmigrant’s employment.\nA treaty trader is not required to file a new Form I-129 to notify USCIS about non-substantive changes. A treaty trader or E-1 employee enterprise may seek advice from USCIS, however, to determine whether a change is considered substantive. To request advice, the treaty trader or enterprise must file Form I-129 with fee and a complete description of the change.\nSee\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(8) for more information on terms and conditions of E-1 treaty trader status.\nA strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage at the intended place of employment may affect a Canadian or Mexican treaty trader or employee’s ability to obtain E-1 status. See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(22) for details.\nFamily of E-1 Treaty Traders and Employees\nTreaty traders and employees may be accompanied or followed by spouses and unmarried children who are under 21 years of age. Their nationalities need not be the same as the treaty trader or employee. Spouses and children may seek E-1 nonimmigrant classification as dependents and, if approved, generally will be granted the same period of stay as the employee. If the family members are already in the United States and seeking changes of status to or extensions of stay in an E-1 dependent classification, they may apply by filing a single Form I-539,\nApplication to Change/Extend Nonimmigrant Status\n, with fee.\nSpouses of E-1 workers in valid E-1 or E-1S status are considered employment authorized incident to status, except for spouses of employees of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) and Taipei Economic and Cultural Offices (TECO), who continue to be required to apply for employment authorization per 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(2).\nDHS-issued evidence of such employment authorization, particularly that may be presented to employers for completion of Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, include:\nAn unexpired Form I-94 with a notation reflecting E-1S nonimmigrant status. As of Jan. 30, 2022, USCIS and CBP began issuing Forms I-94 with a new admission code for certain spouses of E-1 workers: E-1S. An unexpired Form I-94 reflecting this new code is acceptable as evidence of employment authorization under List C of Form I-9;\nAn unexpired Form I-94 with a notation reflecting E-1 nonimmigrant status, together with a notice from USCIS regarding the new admission code. USCIS will send E spouses with a Form I-94 issued by USCIS before Jan. 30, 2022, that was notated with E-1 nonimmigrant status and who are employment authorized incident to status, a notice regarding the new admission code that, together with an unexpired Form I-94 reflecting E-1 nonimmigrant status, serves as evidence of employment authorization for such spouses under List C of Form I-9. For more information, see this\nweb alert\n;\nAn unexpired Employment Authorization Document (EAD). E spouses who are employment authorized incident to status are not required to request employment authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, but may still file Form I-765, with fee, in order to obtain an Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766 or EAD). EADs are acceptable as evidence of both identity and employment authorization under List A of Form I-9; or\nA facially expired EAD with additional documentation to show the EAD is automatically extended. See our\nAutomatic Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Extension\npage for more information on this automatic extension.\nAs discussed above, the E-1 treaty trader or employee may travel abroad and will generally be granted an automatic two-year period of admission when returning to the United States. Unless the family members are accompanying the E-1 treaty trader or employee at the time the latter seeks admission to the United States, or the family members separately travel abroad and return to the United States within the new readmission period, the new readmission period will not apply to the family members. To remain lawfully in the United States, family members must carefully note the period of stay they have been granted in E status and apply for an extension of stay before their own validity expires.\nMore Information\nOther USCIS Links\nVIBE Program\nWork Authorization\nDepartment of State\nTreaty Countries\nElectronic Visa Application Forms\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n04/08/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

It must meet applicable legal requirements for doing business within its jurisdiction.\nMarginal Enterprises\nThe investment enterprise may not be marginal. A marginal enterprise is one that does not have the present or future capacity to generate more than enough income to provide a minimal living for the treaty investor and his or her family. Depending on the facts, a new enterprise might not be considered marginal even if it lacks the current capacity to generate such income. In such cases, however, the enterprise should have the capacity to generate such income within five years from the date that the treaty investor’s E-2 classification begins. See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(15).\nGeneral Qualifications of the Employee of a Treaty Investor\nTo qualify for E-2 classification, the employee of a treaty investor must:\nBe the same nationality of the principal alien employer (who must have the nationality of the treaty country);\nMeet the definition of “employee” under relevant law; and\nEither be engaging in duties of an executive or supervisory character, or if employed in a lesser capacity, have special qualifications.\nIf the principal alien employer is not an individual, it must be an enterprise or organization at least 50% owned by persons in the United States who have the nationality of the treaty country. These owners must either: (a) be maintaining nonimmigrant treaty investor status or (b) if the owners are not in the United States, they must be, if they were to seek admission to this country, classifiable as nonimmigrant treaty investors.  See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(3)(ii).\nDuties that are of an executive or supervisory character are those which primarily provide the employee ultimate control and responsibility for the enterprise’s overall operation, or a major component of it.  See\n8 CFR\n214.2(e)(17) for a more complete definition.\nSpecial qualifications are skills and/or aptitudes which make the employee’s services essential to the efficient operation of the treaty enterprise. There are several qualities or circumstances that could, depending on the facts, meet this requirement.
