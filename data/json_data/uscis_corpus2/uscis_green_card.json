      "content": "Green Card Processes and Procedures\nEach Green Card category have specific steps and procedures to follow. Listed below are some general processes and procedures to help you apply either while in the United States (known as “adjustment of status”) or while outside the United States (known as “consular processing”).\nPage Title\nSummary\nGreen Card Eligibility Categories\nDetermine if you are eligible for permanent resident status. Review the eligibility requirements needed before applying for your Green Card.\nAdjustment of Status\nAdjusting your status to a permanent resident is the process immigrants use to get a Green Card while in the United States.\nConsular Processing\nConsular processing is the method immigrants use to get their Green Card when outside the United States or when ineligible to adjust status in the United States.\nConcurrent Filing\nWhen getting a Green Card through employment, family, or as a special immigrant, someone may need to file a petition for you. Concurrent filing is generally when the immigrant petition is filed at the same time you file your application to get a Green Card. Learn what concurrent filing is and what categories are eligible to concurrently file.\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\nIn general, a visa must be available for you before you can apply for a Green Card. In some categories, visas are always available, while in others, there are a limited number. Priority dates are given to immigrants waiting in line to get an immigrant visa and determine when a visa becomes available. Learn how to tell if a visa is available to you.\nTravel Documents\nLearn more about if and when you can travel outside the United States after applying for a Green Card or once you have a Green Card. You can also learn how to apply for advance parole, a Refugee Travel Document, and a re-entry permit.\nEmployment Authorization Document\nLearn more about if you are eligible for work authorization in the United States and how to apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).\nImmigration Medical Examinations\nMost applications for a Green Card require a medical exam. Learn about who must complete a medical exam and the specific forms and procedures that you must follow.\nAffidavit of Support\nAn affidavit of support is a form that a sponsor files on your behalf when you are applying for a Green Card or immigrant visa. It is required for some (but not all) categories of immigrants before they can become a permanent resident of the United States. The purpose of the form is to show you have the financial means to live in the United States without needing welfare or financial benefits from the U.S. government.\nPublic Charge\nTo get a Green Card, most immigrants must show that they will not become a public charge. Learn more about\npublic charge\n.\nChild Status Protection Act\nYour age can determine whether you are eligible for a Green Card as a “child.” The Child Status Protection Act, often referred to as CSPA, allows certain children who have aged out (become 21 years or older) after an immigrant petition has been filed to still be eligible for a Green Card through their parents.\nTransfer of Underlying Basis\nAn adjustment of status applicant occasionally prefers to have their pending application considered under a different immigrant category. For more information about transferring, see the\nUSCIS Policy Manual\n.\nTo transfer the basis of your pending adjustment of status application to a different eligibility category, you generally must submit a written request to the USCIS office with jurisdiction over the application.  USCIS has also established a new location that should be used for submitting transfer requests between employment-based categories.  See\nGreen Card for Employment-Based Immigrants, Transfer of Underlying Basis\n.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n10/19/2022\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.
