The following resources provide information that may be helpful to those impacted.\nGeneral Department of State Visa Updates:\nU.S. Department of State Consular Affairs X (formerly Twitter)\nU.S. Department of State Consular Affairs Facebook\nLatest Updates on the Israel-Hamas Conflict\nInformation for U.S. Citizens in the Middle East\nU.S. Citizens in the West Bank Needing an Emergency Passport or Assistance to Depart\nRegional Embassy Visa Pages:\nEmbassy Jerusalem Visa Page\nEmbassy Cairo Visa Page\nEmbassy Beirut Visa Page\nEmbassy Amman Visa Page\nRegional Embassy Visa Operations Updates:\nEmbassy Beirut\nEmbassy Jerusalem\nEmbassy Amman\nUnforeseen circumstances, such as natural catastrophes (hurricanes, wildfires, severe weather, etc.), national emergencies (public health emergencies), severe illness (including COVID), or conflicts abroad, can sometimes affect the processing of your USCIS application, petition, or immigration request.\nUSCIS has discretion to take the below measures on a case-by-case basis upon request, if you have been affected by an unforeseen circumstance.\nYou can request assistance by calling the\nUSCIS Contact Center\nat 800-375-5283. For people with disabilities: (TTY) 800-767-1833. In order to request an expedite through the Contact Center, you must have already filed a benefit request and have a receipt number.\nWhen you request help, please explain how the impact of an unforeseen circumstance (domestic or international) created a need for the requested relief. For example, if you lost all evidence of status or employment authorization, include an explanation in your description and a copy of a police report, insurance claim, or other report, if available, to support your request.\nDomestically, USCIS will apply flexibilities as appropriate to individuals affected by natural catastrophes who live in a location that FEMA has identified as a disaster area for purposes of public assistance. When you request assistance, please include evidence that you reside in one of the affected counties, in addition to how the catastrophe created a need for the requested relief. USCIS may also apply such flexibilities as appropriate to individuals affected by emergent situations independent of any FEMA designation.\nPlease update your address with USCIS to ensure you receive all correspondence and benefits from us in a timely manner and avoid possible delays related to your case. To update your address with USCIS, visit our\nHow to Change Your Address\npage. Please note that changing your address with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will not change your address with USCIS. Please contact USPS if you need to temporarily hold or forward your mail due to unforeseen circumstances or a temporary relocation.\nHow to Create a USCIS Online Account\nThe best reasons to get a USCIS online account are that you can file forms online and track your case anytime from anywhere. The first step is to\ncreate an account\n.\nIf you work with an attorney or representative, they can also create their own account to manage your case, but they cannot use your account.\nThe\nHow to Create a USCIS Online Account\npage provides step-by-step information on how to create a USCIS online account. Once you have an account, you will be able to file forms and pay fees from your computer, phone, or tablet.\nExtensions and Changes of Status\nYou may request an extension of stay or change of status using\nForm I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status\n, or in the case of certain employment-based classifications,\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\n. If an unforeseen circumstance prevented your planned and timely departure, you may extend or change your status and provide an explanation for your failure to depart.\nIf you do not apply for the extension or change of status before your authorized period of admission expires, we may excuse the delay if it was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control.\nOptions for Nonimmigrant Workers who Need to Extend Their Stay in the United States\nIf an unforeseen circumstance prevented your planned and timely departure, you may extend or change your status and provide an explanation for your failure to depart. If you do not apply for the extension or change of status before your authorized period of admission expires, we may excuse the delay if it was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control.\nThe maximum 60-day grace period provides time for a nonimmigrant worker in certain categories to retain their nonimmigrant status. Alternatively, the 60-day grace period provides time for the worker to request a change of status, which may allow the worker to continue their job search from within the United States, even if the grace period and the worker’s current nonimmigrant status expire. This is because a worker may remain in an authorized period of stay based on a timely filed nonfrivolous application to change to a new nonimmigrant status.\nRead more on our\nOptions for Nonimmigrant Workers Following Termination of Employment\npage.\nFee Waiver\nIf you are unable to pay the fee for a USCIS service or benefit, you may request a fee waiver for certain forms by filing\nForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiver\n.\nDocument Replacement\nYou may also request\nexpedited processing\nfor the replacement of lost or damaged immigration documents, such as your Green Card, your Employment Authorization Document (EAD), or Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record.\nIf your documents were lost, stolen, or damaged, and you need proof of employment eligibility, see the list of\nForm I-9 acceptable documents and receipts\nfor other ways to complete Form I-9.

If you have any questions or issues about using E-Verify from a remote location, please contact E-Verify Support at 888-464-4218 (for employers) or 888-897-7781 (for employees).\nSevere Economic Hardship to F-1 Students Caused by Unforeseen Circumstances\nIf you experience severe economic hardship because of unforeseen circumstances beyond your control, you may request employment authorization to work off-campus (if you meet certain regulatory requirements). See\n8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)\n. Examples of unforeseen circumstances include (but are not limited to):\nLoss of financial aid or on-campus employment (through no fault of your own);\nSubstantial fluctuations in currency value or exchange rate;\nInordinate increases in tuition or living costs;\nUnexpected changes in the financial condition of your source of support;\nMedical bills; and\nOther substantial and unexpected expenses.\nTo apply, you must submit\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, along with a copy of your\nForm I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status\n, and any other supporting materials to USCIS.\nYour Form I-20 must include the employment page completed by your Designated School Official, certifying your eligibility for off-campus employment due to severe economic hardship caused by unforeseen circumstances beyond your control.\nIf your request is approved, you may be able to work off-campus in one-year intervals up to the expected date of completion of your current course of study. See\n8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(ii)\n.\nSpecial Student Relief\nSpecial Student Relief (SSR) is the suspension of certain regulatory requirements by the secretary of Homeland Security for F‑1 students from parts of the world that are experiencing emergent circumstances. Examples of emergent circumstances include natural catastrophe, war and military conflicts, and national or international financial crises. DHS designates SSR by publication of a Federal Register notice, which provides the start and end dates of the suspension of those requirements, which may include any or all requirements for on-campus or off-campus employment.

Instead, alien veterans living outside the U.S. must seek visas or parole to enter the country for a naturalization interview.\nWe are updating guidance on uncharacterized discharges consistent with changes to the Department of Defense Instructions (DODI) and in alignment with Sections 328 and 329 of the INA. On Aug. 1, 2024, the U.S. Department of War amended the DODI 1332.14 Enlisted Administrative Separations to remove a provision that previously treated “uncharacterized” discharges as “the required characterization” for “administrative matters.” It also addressed entry-level separations as a distinct and separate category of discharges apart from honorable and general (under honorable conditions) discharges.\nConsistent with that update to DODI, an alien military service member seeking naturalization under sections 328 and 329 of the INA, and issued an uncharacterized discharge before Aug. 1, 2024, meets the separation “under honorable conditions” requirement for naturalization, while an alien military service member seeking naturalization under sections 328 and 329 of the INA, and issued an uncharacterized discharge on or after Aug. 1, 2024, does not meet the separation “under honorable conditions” requirement for naturalization purposes.\nAliens who separated or were discharged from the military under less than honorable conditions for reasons like failure to comply with COVID vaccination requirements may request a change in the “characterization of their discharge” from the Department of War. We will rely on submitted official discharge documents for former service members to determine if they served honorably and were separated under honorable conditions.\nThe update also replaces all instances of Department of Defense with Department of War in accordance with Executive Order 14347, Restoring the United States Department of War (Sept. 5, 2025).\nThese updates to\nVolume 12, Part I, Chapter 2, 3 and 5\nof the USCIS\nPolicy Manual\nare consistent with Executive Order (\nEO) 14148\n, Initial Recissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions;\nEO 14161\n, Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats; and\nEO 14184\n, Reinstating Service Members Discharged Under the Military’s COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate.

The new guidance applies to requests filed on or after August 15, 2025. We will apply the\nFeb. 14, 2023\n, policy of CSPA age calculation to adjustment of status applications pending with USCIS before August 15, 2025, as these aliens may have relied on that policy when they filed.\nThis policy update ensures both USCIS and the Department of State use the Final Action Dates chart in the Visa Bulletin to determine when a visa becomes available for the purposes of CSPA age calculation. This establishes a consistent CSPA age calculation for aliens who apply for adjustment of status and immigrant visas. The Feb. 14, 2023, policy resulted in inconsistent treatment of aliens who applied for adjustment of status in the United States versus aliens outside the United States who applied for an immigrant visa with the Department of State.\nGenerally, an unmarried alien child must be under age 21 to obtain lawful permanent resident status in the United States based on their parent’s approved petition for a family-sponsored, employment-based, or diversity visa. If they turn 21 and age out during the immigration process, they generally are no longer eligible to immigrate based on their parent’s petition. Congress enacted the CSPA to protect certain alien children from losing their eligibility for lawful permanent resident status based on an approved visa petition. The CSPA provides a method to calculate the alien’s age that considers when an immigrant visa number “becomes available.”\nIf an alien is applying for adjustment of status under a family-sponsored, employment-based preference, or diversity visa, they must seek to acquire lawful permanent residence within one year of when a visa becomes available to benefit from the CSPA age calculation. This update also clarifies that we consider an alien to have satisfied the “sought to acquire” requirement if they demonstrate extraordinary circumstances for failing to seek lawful permanent resident status within one year of when a visa becomes available. If an alien demonstrates extraordinary circumstances for not applying for adjustment of status during the period of the Feb. 14, 2023, policy before August 15,2025, we will calculate CSPA age under the Feb. 14, 2023, policy.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n08/08/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

If an alien requests an EAD after we approve a new period of parole (re-parole) by filing\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n, the fee will be the lower H.R. 1 fee of $275;\nA new Special Immigrant Juvenile fee of $250 for any alien who files a\nForm I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant\n, as a special immigrant juvenile; and\nIncreasing the maximum cost to register for TPS using\nForm I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status\n, from $50 to $500.\nAny alien who filed or files a Form I-589 after October 1, 2024, that remains pending with USCIS for 365 days must pay the AAF is of the one-year anniversary of his or her filing date and each year thereafter that the application remains pending on such day of the calendar year. For the first time the AAF is due, aliens who file for asylum do not need to monitor the time their application has been pending and if the AAF applies to them. USCIS will issue personal notices to aliens when their annual asylum fee is due, which will include the amount of the fee, when it must be paid, how the fee must be paid, and the consequences of failing to pay. USCIS will provide guidance for future years’ AAF payments in subsequent issuances.\nH.R. 1 also changed validity periods for some EAD categories. For alien parolees, initial employment authorization is valid for a period of no more than one year or for the duration of the alien’s parole, whichever is shorter. For aliens with TPS, initial and renewal employment authorizations are valid for no more than one year or for the duration of the alien’s TPS status, whichever is shorter.\nUSCIS will add the fees listed in H.R. 1 to the fees in 8 CFR part 106. Each fee must be submitted separately. That means that the fees in H.R. 1 do not supersede or replace those promulgated by the USCIS Fee Rule, rather they will be charged “in addition” to current fees. If the requestor is eligible for a fee waiver for the existing fees under 8 CFR 106.3(a), he or she may submit\nForm I-912, Request for Fee Waiver\n, or a written fee waiver request, in addition to the H.R. 1 fee. The new H.R. 1 fees cannot be waived or reduced.\nThe FRN does not cover all the new fees required by H.R. 1. DHS will announce implementation of fees not covered in this FRN in a future action. These forms have associated fee changes that are not included in this FRN:\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records\n; and\nForm I-102, Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Document\n.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n07/18/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "Tibetan Man Sentenced to 27 Months in Prison for Filing Fraudulent Asylum Claims for Profit\nRelease Date\n10/22/2025\nNew York\n– Tenzin Norbu, a Tibetan man, was sentenced to 27 months in prison and ordered to pay forfeiture in the amount of $170,000 for his participation in a scheme to commit immigration fraud and make false statements on asylum applications submitted to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. USCIS, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York worked together for over three years in the investigation that led to Norbu’s conviction.\nNorbu, 56, sold his fraudulent services to applicants and filed dozens of false asylum applications with USCIS from 2007 to 2018. Following his extradition to the United States from Canada, Norbu was indicted by a grand jury in March 2024. In May 2025, Norbu pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit asylum fraud and make false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and he was sentenced Oct. 15 by the Honorable Kimba M. Wood, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.\nAccording to documents filed in this case and statements made in court, Norbu engaged in a deliberate, brazen fraud scheme in which he and others sold fraudulent asylum applications to immigrants seeking asylum in the United States for over a decade. Those false asylum applications all contained a boilerplate narrative that the applicant was a Tibetan and would thus face persecution if removed to China-controlled Tibet. These boilerplate narratives were lies conjured up by Norbu and his associates. Norbu also coached his customers on how to answer questions about the fake narratives and provided them with fake identification documents, all in exchange for a fee. As law enforcement caught on this fraud scheme, Norbu left the country for Canada, where he resisted extradition proceedings for nearly five years in an apparent effort to avoid criminal prosecution in the United States.\nThe government estimates that Norbu charged approximately $5,000 for each client for whom he prepared and submitted a false asylum application. The forfeiture amount of $170,000 represents the total proceeds traceable to the offense to which Norbu pleaded guilty.\nNorbu’s crimes left nearly 100 people with their immigration status in limbo, some of whom appear to have had valid claims to asylum even without the false narratives that Norbu prepared for them and others of whom appear to have had asylum granted to them without merit.\nProtecting the integrity of the immigration process is a priority for USCIS.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provided key assistance during the investigation.\nIn June, a federal grand jury returned a four-count indictment charging Anthony Emmanuel Labrador-Sierra, a Venezuelan national, with possession of a firearm by an alien unlawfully in the United States, making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm, and two counts of making or using false writings or documents. The defendant pleaded guilty to all charges Sept. 22 before U.S. District Judge James R. Knepp.\nAccording to the indictment, the defendant submitted a false date of birth to USCIS on federal applications for Temporary Protected Status and Employment Authorization Documents in 2024 and 2025.\nIn the original criminal complaint and underlying affidavit filed in May, investigators found that Perrysburg Schools reported to the Perrysburg Police Department that they received information that Labrador-Sierra, a student attending Perrysburg High School, was not a minor, but was instead a 24-year-old man who had enrolled under false pretenses.\nLabrador-Sierra faces up to 15 years in prison for possession of a firearm by an alien; up to 10 years in prison for making a false statement during the purchase of a firearm; and up to five years in prison for using false documents. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Sentencing is scheduled for Jan. 23, 2026.\nThis case is being investigated by the City of Perrysburg Police Department, U.S. Customs and Border Protection−Sandusky Bay Station, the FBI Toledo Field Office, the ATF, with assistance from the Wood County Prosecutor’s Office.\nProtecting the integrity of the immigration process is a priority for USCIS.

      "content": "DHS Streamlines the Filing Process for Certain Agricultural Workers\nRelease Date\n09/30/2025\nDHS, DOL modernize and streamline the H-2A process for agricultural employers\nWASHINGTON\n— The Department of Homeland Security is announcing a\nfinal rule\n, effective Oct. 2, 2025, to streamline the filing process for certain temporary agricultural worker petitions.\nThe new rule allows U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to begin processing petitions for H-2A temporary agricultural workers while the Department of Labor reviews the requested employment to ensure it would not harm American workers.\n“This change allows USCIS to support American farmers in their critical work for our nation while also ensuring that they hire thoroughly screened and vetted foreign labor. When migrants choose legal pathways to employment in the United States, it is beneficial for American businesses, the public’s confidence in the rule of law, and the foreign workers themselves,” said USCIS Spokesperson Matthew Tragesser.\nBeginning Oct.2, petitioners seeking unnamed beneficiaries can electronically file the newly published\nForm I-129H2A, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker: H-2A Classification\n, after DOL issues a notice of acceptance of the application for temporary labor certification (TLC) and before DOL approves a TLC. Petitioners must provide the ETA case number issued by DOL with the initial filing. This allows USCIS to immediately begin processing electronically filed petitions with unnamed beneficiaries and gives petitioners the flexibility to file with USCIS sooner. USCIS will not approve any petitions until after DOL has approved the corresponding TLC.\nThe TLC serves as DHS’s consultation with the DOL regarding whether an able, willing, and qualified U.S. worker is available to fill the petitioning H-2A employer’s job opportunity and whether an alien worker’s employment in the job opportunity will adversely affect the wages or working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.\nThe newly developed streamlined version of Form I-129, called Form I-129H2A, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker: H-2A Classification, can only be filed online by uploading the completed PDF in a\nUSCIS online account\n. USCIS will reject any paper filed Form I-129H2A petitions. At this time, we are only accepting Form I-129H2A for petitioners seeking unnamed beneficiaries filing without Form G-28. In the coming weeks, we will expand availability of Form I-129H2A to H-2A petitioners seeking named beneficiaries or filing with Form G-28. For petitioners who prefer to file their H-2A petition by paper, there is no change, and they must continue to use Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker. The procedural change in this rule does not apply to H-2A petitions with named beneficiaries or to H-2A petitioners who file by paper. These petitioners must continue to submit petitions to USCIS only after DOL approves the TLC application.\nFor more information on USCIS and its programs, please visit\nuscis.gov\nor follow us on\nX (formerly Twitter)\n,\nInstagram\n,\nYouTube\n,\nFacebook\nand\nLinkedIn\n.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n09/30/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

      "content": "USCIS Announces Results of Operation Twin Shield, a Large-Scale Immigration Fraud Investigation\nRelease Date\n09/30/2025\nImmigration officers discovered immigration fraud in forms of marriage fraud, fake death certificates and other bizarre schemes\nMINNEAPOLIS –\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in coordination with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, conducted Operation Twin Shield, the first of its kind targeted surge of fraud detection and deterrence activities across Minneapolis-St. Paul and surrounding areas Sept. 19 to 28 —immigration officers discovered suspected fraud in 275 cases in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.\nThe effort focused on site visits and targeted verifications for applicants and petitioners with pending immigration benefits who matched specified risk criteria. The operation aligns with\nExecutive Order 14161\n, Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threat. The types of applications for immigration benefits investigated included marriage and family-based petitions, employment authorizations, and certain parole-related requests.\nOperation Twin Shield was a resounding success: USCIS officers focused on more than 1,000 cases that had fraud or ineligibility indicators, conducted over 900 site visits and in-person interviews, and found evidence of fraud, non-compliance, or public safety or national security concerns in 275 cases—44 percent of cases interviewed. USCIS coordinated with our ICE and FBI partners, who provided valuable assistance during the operation. As of today, USCIS issued Notices to Appear (NTAs) or referred aliens to ICE in 42 cases, and 4 aliens were apprehended. USCIS expects data on NTAs, referrals to ICE, and adverse adjudicative actions to increase as more administrative investigations are completed.\nOperation Twin Shield uncovered many lies. For example, one alien admitted to fabricating a death certificate from Kenya for $100 to falsely claim the termination of a marriage—the spouse in question is alive, residing in Minneapolis, and is the mother of five of his children. In another case, an alien is the son of a known or suspected terrorist, he also overstayed his visa, and was previously found to have engaged in marriage fraud that resulted in the denial of several immigration benefit requests. In another case, a petitioner admitted to officers with Operation Twin Shield that she commited marriage fraud; this was only a few hours after swearing that her marriage was bona fide during an interview at our Minneapolis office. In another case, an alien engaged in marriage fraud by taking advantage of an elderly U.S. citizen spouse, including subjecting the spouse to elder abuse and exploitation. This is a small sample of the immigration fraud USCIS officers across the nation combat every single day.\n“USCIS is declaring an all-out war on immigration fraud. We will relentlessly pursue everyone involved in undermining the integrity of our immigration system and laws. With help from ICE and the FBI, USCIS’ Operation Twin Shield was a tremendous success—hundreds of bad actors will be held accountable,” said USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow. “Immigration fraud undermines the integrity of our lawful immigration system, harms those who follow the law, and poses risks to national security and public safety. Under President Trump, we will leave no stone unturned.”\nOperation Twin Shield is the first time USCIS dedicated resources on this scale in a single geographical area. Unlike during the Biden administration, USCIS immigration officers are now empowered to thoroughly vet aliens as required by law, and to pursue immigration fraud wherever it’s encountered.\nComplete press conference recording:\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy6nDOnLVjU\nFor more information on USCIS and its programs, please visit\nuscis.gov\nor follow us on\nX (formerly Twitter)\n,\nInstagram\n,\nYouTube\n,\nFacebook\nand\nLinkedIn\n.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n09/30/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

Va.\n–\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provided valuable assistance to the investigation leading to guilty pleas from a Greenbrier couple for immigration crimes.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office\nannounced\nRajesh N. Patel, 51, of Ronceverte, pleaded guilty to knowingly transporting an illegal alien, and his wife Avanibahen Patel, 44, pleaded guilty to unlawful employment of aliens.\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, from November 2020 through at least September 2024, Aakash Prakash Makwana, 30, a citizen of India unlawfully residing in Ronceverte, was employed at a Fairlea business owned and operated by the Patels. Makwana assisted with the daily running of the business during the time period. As part of their guilty pleas, the Patels each admitted that they agreed to hire Makwana knowing that he was living in the United States illegally after his immigration visa expired.\nRajesh N. Patel further admitted that he drove Makwana to and from work and other locations because Makwana did not own a vehicle. Rajesh N. Patel also admitted that he did not collect or pay over to the United States government any payroll taxes from Makwana’s gross pay, and paid Makwana’s rent and supplied him with groceries during most of the time Makwana was employed at the business.\nMakwana\npleaded guilty\non May 14, to aggravated identity theft, admitting that he committed the offense as part of a scheme to marry a United States citizen to evade U.S. immigration laws. In or around August 2021, Makwana conspired with others to marry a U.S. citizen so he could apply for Lawful Permanent Residence status, also known as obtaining a Green Card. The marriage fraud scheme was not successful. Makwana is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 26.\nAs part of his guilty plea, Rajesh N. Patel admitted that he knew of the marriage fraud conspiracy and aided and abetted it by making cash payments to Makwana’s co-conspirators. Kalee Ann Huff, 28, of Fairbury, Illinois, admitted to marrying Makwana as part of the conspiracy and was\nsentenced\non June 12, to five years of federal probation for marriage fraud and perjury. Huff’s brother-in-law, Joseph Sanchez, admitted to helping to arrange the fake marriage and to pressuring Huff to take part. Sanchez, 33, of Fairbury, Illinois, was\nsentenced\nto five years of federal probation on May 28 for participating in an immigration marriage fraud conspiracy.\nRajesh N. Patel is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 9, 2026, and faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.

They also fabricated false documents to support their clients’ applications with USCIS without their clients’ knowledge. They then mailed, or caused to be mailed, these fraudulent applications and documents to USCIS, where they were received and made part of the official alien file of each respective client.\nMany of the Khans’ clients received no relief from USCIS despite paying the Khans significant amounts of money. To generate fees from clients, Khatija Khan filed applications with USCIS even when the submissions lacked merit or a legitimate basis. Victims lost more than $300,000 as a result of this scheme.\nIn addition, in the 2016 tax year, Babar Khan failed to report to the IRS approximately $27,901 in additional taxable income and failed to pay an additional $7,942 in federal taxes that were owed.\nBabar Khan and Khatija Khan were\narrested\non Dec. 19, 2019.  After her arrest, Khatija Khan continued to defraud multiple clients.\nOn Feb. 28, 2022, Babar Khan\npleaded guilty\nto one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and one count of making and subscribing a false tax return.\nKhatija Khan pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count of mail fraud. On Sept. 1, 2022, she was\nsentenced\nto 60 months of imprisonment.\nBabar Khan, who is released on a $50,000 bond, is required to report to prison on March 18, 2026.\nU.S. District Judge Stefan R. Underhill ordered Babar Khan to pay $371,743 in restitution, of which $367,743.75 is to be paid jointly and severally with Khatija Khan.\nThis matter was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations, and the Internal Revenue Service – Criminal Investigation Division, with assistance from USCIS. This case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Hal Chen.\nProtecting the integrity of the immigration process is a priority for USCIS.

The 2025 test assesses an alien’s understanding of U.S. history and government in line with the statutory requirement and is one of many steps in an ongoing effort to restore integrity to the naturalization process and meet congressional intent. Naturalization is a privilege that allows aliens to become fully vested members of American society, with important rights and responsibilities that all citizens should exercise and respect.\n“American citizenship is the most sacred citizenship in the world and should only be reserved for aliens who will fully embrace our values and principles as a nation. By ensuring only those aliens who meet all eligibility requirements, including the ability to read, write, and speak English and understand U.S. government and civics, are able to naturalize, the American people can be assured that those joining us as fellow citizens are fully assimilated and will contribute to America’s greatness. These critical changes are the first of many,” said USCIS Spokesperson Matthew Tragesser.\nUSCIS has already announced several changes, including restoring robust vetting for all aliens and stricter reviews of disability exceptions to the English and civics requirements. USCIS has also provided officers guidance on assessing aliens’ good moral character, looking for positive contributions to American society instead of a mere absence of bad behavior. The agency is also resuming neighborhood investigations to ensure that aliens meet statutory requirements and are worthy of U.S. citizenship. Other recent policies include clarifying that unlawfully voting, unlawfully registering to vote, and making false claims to U.S. citizenship disqualify aliens from showing good moral character.\nIn the coming weeks and months, USCIS will announce other initiatives to further enhance the integrity of the naturalization process.\nFor more information, see the\nFederal Register notice\n.

This is part of the Department of Homeland Security’s ongoing fight to restore sanity and common sense to our immigration system, which was deliberately abused by the Biden administration to flood the United States with criminal illegal aliens and others who work to subvert American peace and security.\n“After years of abuse, sanity is returning to our immigration system,”\nsaid DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.\n“American citizenship is a sacred trust, and it should never be treated lightly. To be an American citizen is to commit yourself to upholding our values, culture, and Constitution. We are doing everything in our power to make sure that anyone who is offered the privilege of becoming an American citizen fulfills their obligation to their new country.”\nUnder President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, USCIS has\nimplemented much-needed reforms\nto the naturalization process. Now, aliens who apply for immigration benefits, including naturalization, are being vetted for Anti-American activity, support for terrorism, and other potentially disqualifying behavior.\nThis newly enhanced vetting process includes reinstating neighborhood interviews of potential new citizens, considering whether aliens have made positive contributions to their communities, determining good moral character, and verifying they have never unlawfully registered to vote or unlawfully attempted to vote in an American election. USCIS has also overhauled the citizenship test, making it more difficult to ensure that only those who are truly committed to the American way of life are admitted as citizens.\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n09/17/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

Kuah and Wongbi were arrested Sept. 5 in Minnesota, the U.S. Department of Justice\nannounced\n.\nAccording to the indictment, the defendants held leadership roles in the self-styled Ambazonia Defense Forces (ADF), a separatist militia seeking to create an independent country in Cameroon. Together, they allegedly used their positions to raise money and finance the purchase of weapons, and directed their co-conspirators in Cameroon to kidnap, bomb, and kill civilians, government officials, and members of the security forces to intimidate the civilian population and coerce the Cameroonian Government into recognizing their legitimacy.\nAccording to the indictment, beginning in 2017, the defendants sent thousands of dollars to co-conspirators in Cameroon for weapons and explosives and directed attacks that left civilians dead, injured, or taken hostage. In 2022, the fighters kidnapped a government official and broadcast propaganda videos about the abduction. In 2023, Kuah helped plan an improvised explosive device attack targeting a regional governor and later financed a bombing at the Mount Cameroon Race for Hope that injured 19 people. That same year, a commander appointed by Kuah murdered two unarmed civilians in a market square, while Wongbi appeared in a propaganda video threatening others with the same fate. In 2024, Kuah allegedly approved the funding and operational plan for a bombing at a Youth Day celebration that killed a 15-year-old girl and injured dozens of other children.\nThe indictment further alleges that Kuah and Wongbi raised money online to support their operations, including campaigns branded as “The Takeover Fund” and “Operation 200AKs,” which solicited donations for AK-47 rifles and explosives. Kuah appeared in multiple videos urging supporters to fund the purchase of weapons and ammunition for the fighters.\nThe defendants are charged with conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim, and injure persons abroad, conspiracy to provide material support or resources, and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Kuah is also charged with three counts of providing material support or resources, conspiracy to commit hostage taking and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction outside the United States. If convicted, the defendants face a statutory maximum penalty of life in prison.\nThe FBI’s Minneapolis Field Office is investigating the case, with assistance from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations. USCIS provided key information to HSI, discovered while conducting background checks for a pending immigration application filed by Wongbi.\nProtecting the integrity of the immigration process is a priority for USCIS.
