This form establishes the family relationship that exists between you and your relative. Sometimes the I-130 can be filed together with an application for permanent residence, officially known as\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\n. This is discussed below.\nWhich Relatives May I Petition For?\nImmediate Relatives\nOther Family Members\nSpouses of U.S. citizens\nChildren (unmarried and under 21) of U.S. citizens\nParents of U.S. citizens (The petitioning citizen must be 21 or older.)\nVisas are always available for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. This means your family member does not need to wait in line for a visa. Immediate relatives who are in the United States can file\nForm I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status\nat the same time as Form I-130. For more information on how your relative can apply to adjust status (get a Green Card) while they are in the United States.\nPreference categories apply to family members who are not immediate relatives. The visas allotted for these categories are subject to annual numerical limits. A visa becomes available to a preference category based on the priority date (the date the Form I-130 was filed). Preference categories are grouped as follows:\nFirst preference\n: Unmarried, adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (adult means 21 or older.)\nSecond Preference (2A)\n: Spouses of Green Card holders, unmarried children (under 21) of permanent residents\nSecond Preference (2B)\n: Unmarried adult sons and daughters of permanent residents\nThird Preference\n: Married sons and daughters (any age) of U.S. citizens\nFourth Preference\n: Brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens\nFor current wait times, see the\nUSCIS Processing Time Information\npage on this website and the\nVisa Bulletin\npage on the U.S. Department of State website. For more information on priority dates, see the\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\npage.\nWhat Happens Next?\nIf your relative is already in the United States, they may apply to adjust status to become a Green Card holder (lawful permanent resident) after a visa number becomes available using Form I-485.\nIf your relative is outside the United States, your petition will be sent to the National Visa Center (NVC). The NVC will forward your petition to the appropriate U.S. consulate when a visa becomes available and your relative will be notified about how to proceed. This process is referred to as “consular processing.”\nYour family member’s preference category will determine how long they will have to wait for an immigrant visa number. Once you have filed a petition, you can check its progress the\nMy Case Status\npage. For visa availability information, see the\nVisa Bulletin\npage on the U.S. Department of State website.\nFor more information on becoming a Green Card holder, see the\nAdjustment of Status\nfor processing within the United States and\nConsular Processing\npage for processing overseas. For more information on Green Cards, see the\nGreen Card\nsection.\nNOTE\n: A visa petition (Form I-130 or Form I-129F) is only used to demonstrate a qualifying relationship. An approved petition DOES NOT grant any benefit, it simply creates a place in line for visa processing.\nMembers of the Military\nIf you or a member of your family is in the U.S. military, special conditions may apply.
