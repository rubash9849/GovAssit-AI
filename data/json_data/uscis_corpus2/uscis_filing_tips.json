This warning will be shown in the Special Instructions section of the form landing page. Please make sure you follow those special instructions.\nMany of our form pages have a checklist that will help ensure you submit all of the required documentation with your form.

      "content": "Filing Fees\nAlert Type info\nAlert:\nUSCIS has implemented a new way to pay fees using electronic debit from a U.S. bank account. Effective immediately, individuals can make transactions directly to USCIS by completing and signing Form G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions, and filing it with their applications, petitions, or requests. USCIS will continue to accept paper check and money order payments in addition to credit and debit payments until Oct. 28, 2025.After Oct. 28, USCIS will accept\nonly\nACH debit transactions using Form G-1650 or credit card payments using Form G-1450 for forms filed by paper without an exemption. USCIS continues to accept online payments for forms filed online.\nAlert Type info\nALERT:\nOn July 18, 2025, USCIS\nannounced\nnew fees required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill.\nApplicants must submit the new fees with benefit requests postmarked on or after July 22, 2025. USCIS will reject any form postmarked on or after Aug. 21, 2025, without the proper fees.  For more information about these fees, please visit our\nFee Schedule\npage and our\nweb alert\n.\nA filing fee is required for many immigration forms. If you do not submit the correct fee, we will reject your form.\nOur Fees\nWe periodically adjust our fees. For a complete list of all USCIS fees, see our\nFee Schedule\n.\nYou can use our\nFee Calculator\nto determine the exact filing and, if applicable, biometric services fees for any form.\nHow to Pay USCIS Filing Fees\nHow you pay your USCIS filing fees (including biometric services fees and other fees, if applicable) will depend on whether you are inside or outside of the United States.\nIf you live outside the United States or its territories\nIf you live outside the United States or its territories and you want to file your application, petition, or request where you live, go to the\nForms\nsection of our website to determine if you can file your form at an international office. We do not accept all forms of payment abroad. Check the appropriate\nInternational USCIS office\nwebpage or contact the\nU.S. Embassy or Consulate\nfor information on how to pay USCIS fees.\nIf you are inside the United States\nDepending on the form you are submitting, you may pay your fees:\nOnline using a card or bank withdrawal; or\nBy mail with a card, check, bank draft, or money order.\nWhen filing\nForm I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Record\n, directly with a USCIS field office to request emergency advance parole, you may pay only by card, personal check, or business check. Refer to the USCIS\nEmergency Travel\npage for more information.\nFor more information on filing your specific form, go to the USCIS\nAll Forms\npage. Please see our\nNews\npage for the latest updates.\nMultiple Applications or Methods of Payment\nIf you are submitting\nmultiple forms\n, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms. For example, when filing\nForm I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status\n;\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n; and/or\nForm I-824, Application for Action on an Approved Application or Petition\n, together with a\nForm I-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker\n, you must provide separate payments for each form. If you combine the payments for these forms, we may reject the entire package.\nYou must pay for\neach\napplication, petition, or request you submit using a\nsingle payment method\n(check, bank draft, money order, or card) and not a combination of payment methods. For example, if you file\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, you cannot pay for half the fee with a personal check and half the fee with credit card.\nPay with a Check\nYou may pay fees with bank drafts, cashier’s checks, certified checks, personal or business checks (made payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security), and money orders that are drawn on U.S. financial institutions and payable in U.S. funds. If filing Form I-131 directly with a domestic USCIS field office to request emergency advance parole, you can only pay by personal or business check (or card).\nYou must mail your check, bank draft, or money order together with your benefit request form. Refer to the form instructions for more information. Please see our\nNews\npage for the latest updates.\nIf you are paying your fees by check, please be aware of the following:\nAuthorization for an Electronic Funds Transfer\n: By submitting your check, you authorize us to convert your check into an electronic fund transfer. We will use the account information from your check to make an electronic fund transfer from your checking account for the amount of the check. If the transfer cannot occur for technical reasons, you authorize us to process the copy of your original check through normal paper check procedures.\nInsufficient Funds\n: The electronic fund transfer from your account can occur faster than normal processing for a paper check. If your check or other financial instrument is returned as unpayable, we will resubmit the payment one time. If it is returned as unpayable a second time, we will reject your filing.\nIf your check is not dated within the previous 365 days, we will reject the filing.\nHow to Write Your Check\nPersonal checks must be preprinted with your name and your bank’s name. Your address and phone number must be preprinted, typed, or written in ink.\nWrite the date you are completing the check. Use the U.S. style of month/day/year. (Example: Jan. 4, 2017, or 1/4/17, but not 4/1/17 or 4 JAN 2017.)\nOn the “Pay to the Order of” line, write “U.S. Department of Homeland Security” (not “USDHS” or “DHS”).\nUse numerals to show the exact dollar amount of the fee for the service you are requesting. In the example, the amount is “$760.00.”\nSpell out the exact dollar amount of the fee and write the “cents” portion of the amount as a fraction over 100. In this example, the amount is “Seven hundred sixty and 00/100.”\nWrite a brief description of the purpose of your payment. In this example, it is “N-400 application.” Include the applicant’s name on the memo line if it is not on the check itself (for example, if you are paying the fee for your child).\nSign the check in ink using your legal name.\nIf your check is not dated within the previous 365 days, we will reject the filing.\nPay with a Credit or Debit Card\nIf paying by credit or debit card, you must pay each filing fee separately for each application, petition, or request you submit.\nYou may pay filing and any other applicable fees with a credit or debit card issued by a U.S. bank if you are filing:\nAn application, petition, or request with a\nUSCIS lockbox\n; or\nAn application, petition, or request with the USCIS service centers.\nThere is no additional cost if you pay by credit or debit card. We cannot accept a credit or debit card issued by a foreign bank.\nAcceptable Credit or Debit Cards\nYou may use Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and prepaid cards from the same card networks. Make sure the card’s credit limit can cover the fee. We will reject your application, petition, or request if the card is declined, and we will not attempt to process your credit card payment a second time.\nWe do\nnot\nsupport payment by\ngift cards\n.\nHow to Pay with a Card When Filing by Mail\nTo pay with a card, follow these two steps:\nComplete and sign\nForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions\n.\nPlace the form on top of your application, petition, or request when you file it.\nWhen filing Form G-1450 with a Lockbox or Service Center, you may split the payment for\none form\nacross multiple credit, debit, or prepaid cards that add up the correct total. Complete one Form G-1450 for each card. However, you may use only one Form G-1450 when requesting emergency advance parole from a USCIS field Office. In all cases, the credit, debit, or prepaid card must be from a financial institution located in the United States.\nIf we accept your filing, we will charge your card for the proper amount and destroy your Form G-1450 to protect your card information. (We will destroy it even if we reject your filing and do not process your payment.)\nYou will see a charge from USCIS on your credit card statement.\nThere is a daily transaction limit for credit cards of $24,999.99 per credit card per day set by the Department of the Treasury. We allow an exemption to this limit of up to $99,999.99 for H-1B registrations and petitions submitted online using one credit card.\nSecurity\nWe use the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Pay.gov Trusted Collections Service to process your credit card payment. Trusted Collections Service is a web-based application that allows government agencies to process debit or credit card payments. You cannot pay the fee directly to Pay.gov.\nThe Department of the Treasury ensures that Pay.gov is\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard\ncompliant. This security standard is a set of requirements designed to ensure all companies processing, storing, or transmitting credit card information maintain a secure environment.\nFor your security, we will destroy your Form G-1450 after processing it, regardless of whether we accept or reject your application, petition, or request.\nThird-Party Payments\nAnyone authorized to use a credit card may pay for your application, petition, or request. The cardholder must complete Form G-1450, sign it, and give it to you to submit with your filing.\nDeclined Credit Cards\nIf a credit card is declined, we will not attempt to process the credit card payment again. We will reject your application, petition, or request for lack of payment.\nRejection Notices\nIf we reject your filing, we will send you a notice explaining why we rejected it.\nIf you file a corrected application, petition, or request, and wish to pay again by credit card, you will need to include a new Form G-1450.\nAvoid Immigration Scams\nLearn how to protect yourself from common immigration services scams, and where to report suspected fraud, at\nAvoid Scams\n.\nAnd remember, the current versions of all USCIS forms are always available for free at\nuscis.gov/forms\n.\nIf You File Online\nIf you\nfile your form online\n, the system will guide you through the process of paying your fees with a credit, debit, or prepaid card. Bank account withdrawals are also available when paying online. Once you are ready to submit your form, the system will automatically direct you to the secure Department of the Treasury site, pay.gov, to pay your fees online.\nWe only use pay.gov to process fees. Always check the website address before you pay. Beware of scam websites and scammers who may pretend to be a USCIS website.\nIf You File by Mail\nIf you mail your form to a USCIS Lockbox facility, you may\npay your fees with a debit, credit, or prepaid card\n. To do so, follow these steps:\nComplete and sign\nForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions\n.\nPlace the form on top of your application, petition, or request.\nMail the entire package to the appropriate USCIS Lockbox.\nIf we accept your filing, we will:\nCharge your card for the proper amount; and\nDestroy your Form G-1450 to protect your credit information (we will destroy it even if we reject your filing and do not process your payment).\nYou will see a charge from USCIS on your card statement.\nFor general filing information, see the\nForm Filing Tips\nwebpage.\nUnfunded or Dishonored Payments\nIf we approve your petition, application, or request and the payment has not been properly funded or you subsequently dispute payment of the fee, we may revoke, rescind, or cancel the approval with notice (for example, by issuing a Notice of Intent to Revoke). We will not separately bill you for the unpaid fee. If you receive a Notice of Intent to Revoke, you may respond with payment of the correct fee amount.\nRefund Policy\nWhen you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing and biometric service fees are final and nonrefundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request. Please refer to the form you filed for additional information, or you may call the\nUSCIS Contact Center\nat 800-375-5283 (for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or have a speech disability: TTY 800-767-1833).\nFee Waiver Guidance\nWe are funded largely by application and petition fees. Recognizing that some applicants cannot pay the filing fees, we established a fee waiver process for certain forms and benefit types. We will approve a fee waiver only if you clearly demonstrate that you are unable to pay the filing fees. We carefully consider the merits of each fee waiver request before making a decision.
