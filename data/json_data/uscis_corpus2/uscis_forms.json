Nonetheless, on March 31, 2025, Judge Edward Chen, a federal judge in San Francisco, ordered the department to continue TPS for Venezuelans. See\nNational TPS Alliance, et al., v. Kristi Noem et al.\n, No. 3:25-cv-01766 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2025). The court did so even though the TPS statute says that TPS decisions are not subject to judicial review. For more information, please see the\nFederal Register notice\n. DHS has every intention of ending Venezuela TPS as soon as it obtains relief from the court order. Further updates regarding TPS Venezuela will be posted on this webpage.\nLatest Headlines\nE-Verify Records Scheduled for Disposal\nOctober 21, 2025\nE-Verify employers have until Jan. 4, 2026, to download records for&nbsp;E-Verify&nbsp;cases last updated on or before Dec. 31, 2015.

Syria’s TPS designation and related benefits terminate on Nov. 21, 2025, at 11:59 p.m.\nTopics\nForm I-9\nAll U.S. employers must properly complete Form I-9 for each individual they hire for employment in the United States.\nPreventing Discrimination\nWe provide information on employee rights and preventing discrimination in the workplace.\nLearning Resources\nExplore multimedia content to learn about what the employment eligibility verification process means to you, including your rights, your roles, your employer's responsibilities, and your privacy.\nHandbook for Employers\nRead our guidance for completing Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, in the M-274, Handbook for Employers.\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

All U.S. employers must properly complete Form I-9 for every individual they hire for employment in the United States. This includes citizens and aliens. Both employees and employers (or authorized representatives of the employer) must complete the form.\nOn the form, an employee must attest to their employment authorization. The employee must also present their employer with acceptable documents as evidence of identity and employment authorization. The employer must examine these documents to determine whether they reasonably appear to be genuine and relate to the employee, then record the document information on the employee’s Form I-9. Certain employers who choose to remotely examine the employee’s documentation under a DHS-authorized alternative procedure rather than via physical examination must indicate they did so by checking the box provided. For more information, review the Special Instructions tab below.\nDownload Instructions\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) provides information on\nDownloading and Printing Immigration Forms\nsuch as Form I-9 on your laptop or PC.\nTo open Form I-9 on an Apple mobile device:\nDownload a PDF filler application to your device, if necessary.\nClick the link below using your device.

Any employer may use the Spanish-language form and instructions as a translation tool.\nForm I-9 is a fillable form, which means you can type your answers directly into the form, except for the signature blocks. Employers and employees using this fillable form must print and manually sign it rather than typing or electronically affixing a signature because this fillable form does not meet DHS standards for electronic Form I-9 generation, storage and retention systems. See 8 CFR section 274a.2. Failure to meet DHS standards for electronically generated, stored and/or retained Form I-9 may result in fines and other penalties.\nRelated Links\nHandbook for Employers M-274\nI-9 Central\nE-Verify\nLast Reviewed/Updated:\n04/02/2025\nWas this page helpful?\nYes\nNo\nThis page was not helpful because the content:\nSelect a reason\nhas too little information\nhas too much information\nis confusing\nis out of date\nother\nHow can the content be improved?\n0\n/ 2000\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include any personal information in your feedback.

Go to our\nDirect Filing Addresses for Form I-485\npage to see where you should file your application.\nIf you file at a USCIS lockbox, you may not receive an A-Number on your Form I-797, Notice of Action, due to a change in our business process. In these cases, we will send your A-Number in a second notice a few days after accepting your application.\nWhen to File\nIn general, you may not file your Form I-485 until an immigrant visa is immediately available in your category. For information on the process of adjusting status as a permanent resident, and how to determine whether and when you are eligible to adjust status and file Form I-485, see our\nVisa Availability and Priority Dates\nand\nAdjustment of Status Filing Charts from the Visa Bulletin\npages.

We will also accept a money order, personal check, or cashier’s check. If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nWhen you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request.\nIf you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our\nFee Calculator\nto help determine your fee.\nIf you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.\nChecklist of Required Initial Evidence (for informational purposes only)\nSave time by submitting all required initial evidence and supporting documentation at the same time you file Form I-485.\nView the\nchecklist\nof required initial evidence.\nThe checklist is an optional tool to use as you prepare your form, but does not replace statutory, regulatory, and form instruction requirements. Submitting all required initial evidence and supporting documentation at the same time you file Form I-485 may eliminate the need for us to issue a Request for Evidence to obtain additional documentation and evidence. This may also help avoid adjudication delays if we decide that you do not need to be interviewed.\nIf you are required to submit\nForm I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record\n, or a partial Form I-693 (such as the Vaccination Record), you must submit it with your Form I-485.

Throughout these Instructions, we will sometimes \nrefer to Form I-485 as an application for adjustment of status or as an adjustment application. Read through and follow these Instructions and all instructions as written on the application.\nWho May File Form I-485?\nYou must be physically present in the United States to file this application. Additional eligibility requirements for adjustment of status may vary depending on the immigrant category in which you are applying. For more information on adjustment of status eligibility, go to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website at                      www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/adjustment-status .\nYou may apply as the person who directly qualifies for an immigrant category (“principal applicant”) or, in some cases, as the spouse or the child of a principal applicant (“derivative applicant”). Whether you are a principal or derivative \napplicant, you must file your own Form I-485. See the Additional Instructions  for more details.\nUnder U.S. immigration law, you are a “child” if you are unmarried, under 21 years of age, and meet the definition of “child” found in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and USCIS policy guidance. You may still be considered a child for immigration purposes even after turning 21 years of age if you qualify under the provisions \nof the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) or other applicable provisions. For more information on the CSPA, see                                   \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/child-status-protection-act-cspa . \nWho May Not Be Eligible to Adjust Status?\nBars to Adjustment of Status\nYou are generally ineligible for adjustment of status under INA section 245(a) if one or more adjustment bars in the INA \napply to you. See INA sections 245(a), (c), (d), and/or (e). \nException Under INA section 245(i)\nYou may be able to adjust status under INA section 245(i) even if you are present in the United States without inspection and \nadmission or parole, or are subject to one or more adjustment bars at INA section 245(c). See separate instructions for adjusting status under INA section 245(i), titled “ Instructions for Form I-485 Supplement A,” by visiting www.uscis.gov/i-485supa. \nINA section 245(i) is not an immigrant category. In order to adjust status using INA section 245(i), you must be eligible for an immigrant visa under a family-based, employment-based, special immigrant, or Diversity Visa category\n . You must \nselect one of the immigrant categories listed in Part 2. Application Type or Filing Category .\nGrounds of Inadmissibility\nImmigration laws specify acts, conditions, and conduct that can make aliens ineligible for lawful permanent resident \nstatus. These acts, conditions, and conduct are outlined in INA section 212(a) and are called grounds of inadmissibility. \nFor more information on the grounds of inadmissibility for specific immigrant categories, visit the USCIS Policy Manual at www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8 . If you are inadmissible, you may be eligible for a waiver of the ground of \ninadmissibility or another form of relief. If we approve your waiver application or grant another form of relief, USCIS may approve your application to adjust status, if you are otherwise eligible.\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 3 of 42\nWhen Should I File Form I-485?\nPrincipal Applicant\nIn general, if you are filing as a beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition (such as Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, \nForm I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers, or Form I-360, Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special \nImmigrant), you may file an adjustment application only after USCIS has approved your petition and an immigrant visa number is immediately available. There are, however, some immigrant categories that allow you to file Form I-485 before USCIS approves your petition (this is known as “concurrent filing”), provided that approval of the petition would make an immigrant visa number immediately available to you and you meet all other filing and eligibility requirements. See the Additional Instructions  for category-specific information on when you may file Form I-485.\nVisit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/visa-availability-\nand-priority-dates for information on visa availability, and the Department of State (DOS) website at                              travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html  to view the Visa Bulletin.\nMore information about concurrent filing is available at https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-\nprocedures/concurrent-filing-of-form-i-485 and in the Instructions for Forms I-130, I-140, and I-360.\nDerivative Adjustment Applicant\nIf you are currently the spouse or child of a principal applicant, you may file Form I-485 if an immigrant visa is \nimmediately available to you and you meet all filing requirements. Y\n ou may file at any of the following times:\n• At the same time the principal applicant files Form I-485;\n• After the principal applicant filed a Form I-485 that remains pending a final decision by USCIS;\n• After USCIS approves the principal applicant’s Form I-485, if the principal applicant is still a lawful permanent \nresident and if, at the time of the principal applicant’s Form I-485 approval, you were the principal applicant’s spouse \nor child; or\n• After the principal applicant obtained an immigrant visa and entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident \nif the principal applicant is still a lawful permanent resident and, at the time of the principal applicant’ s entry , you \nwere the principal applicant’s spouse or child.\nGenerally, USCIS cannot approve your Form I-485 as a derivative applicant until the principal applicant obtains lawful \npermanent resident status. USCIS may approve an adjustment application for a U nonimmigrant, asylee, or refugee derivative before the principal applicant obtains lawful permanent resident status.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

You should submit legible photocopies of requested documents unless the Instructions specifically instruct you to \nsubmit an original document. USCIS may request an original document at any time during our process.

See the Additional \nInstructions  for more category-specific information.\nIf either party to the marriage was previously married, you must also submit evidence to prove the legal termination of \nany prior marriages, typically a divorce decree/certificate or death certificate. \nIf you are filing as the derivative applicant child of the principal applicant and your birth certificate does not show \nthat the principal applicant is your parent, you must submit a photocopy of your parents’  marriage certificate, your \nadoption certificate, or other proof of your parent-child relationship with the principal applicant. \n7. Evidence of Continuously Maintaining a Lawful Status Since Arrival in the United States\nAnyone applying under the following immigrant categories must submit evidence to show they have continuously \nmaintained lawful immigration status while in the United States and are therefore not barred from adjustment by INA  \nsection 245(c)(2): \n• Applicants applying under a family-based preference category or an employment-based preference category; \n• Special immigrant religious workers;\n• International broadcasters; and \n• Selectees under the Diversity Visa program.\nAcceptable evidence may include, but is not limited to, copies of the following documents:\n• Form I-797, Notice of Action, for all extensions of stay and changes of nonimmigrant status;\n• Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, including printouts of paperless I-94 admissions;\n• Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (F-1) Student Status – For Academic and Language \nStudents, including all pages containing notations by authorized school officials;\n• Form I-20, Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant (M-1) Student Status – For V ocational Students, including \nall pages containing notations by authorized school officials;\n• Form DS-2019 (formerly IAP 66), Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, including all pages \ncontaining notations by authorized exchange visitor program officials; or\n• Passport page with an admission or parole stamp (issued by a U.S. immigration officer).\nInclude evidence for every time you entered the United States and for the time periods spent in the United States.

At any time during the adjudication process, USCIS may request that you file Supplement J.\nNOTE:  Individuals seeking or granted a National Interest Waiver of the job offer requirement and individuals \nseeking or granted classification as an alien of extraordinary ability under INA  section 203(b)(1)(A) do not need to \nfile Supplement J, because these employment-based immigrant visa categories are not tied to a specific job offer . If \nyou filed or are concurrently filing Form I-140 as a self-petitioner , you must intend to work in the occupational field \nspecified in the Form I-140. You must provide a signed statement confirming this intent, unless you are filing Form \nI-485 at the same time as your Form I-140 or while your Form I-140 is still pending.\n9. Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record (Form I-693)\nApplicants for adjustment of status are generally required to complete an immigration medical examination and \nsubmit a properly completed Form I-693 signed by a civil surgeon to show that they are free from health conditions \nthat would render them inadmissible under the health-related grounds. If you are required to submit a Form I-693, or a \npartial Form I-693 (such as the Vaccination Record), you must submit it with your Form I-485. Otherwise, your Form \nI-485 may be rejected.

An adjudication of \njuvenile delinquency is not a “conviction” under U.S. immigration law , but a juvenile can be charged as an adult for \nan offense committed while a juvenile. If you were convicted as an adult, there is a conviction, regardless of whether \nyou were tried before a criminal court or a juvenile court. An adjudication of juvenile delinquency could also be \nrelevant to the exercise of discretion. If you claim that an arrest resulted in adjudication of delinquency , and not in a \nconviction, you must submit a copy of the court document that establishes this fact.\nIn general, you do not need to submit documentation relating to traffic fines and incidents that did not involve an \nactual physical arrest if the penalty was only a fine of less than $500 or resulted in points on your driver ’s license. \nHowever, you must submit such documentation if the traffic incident resulted in criminal charges or involved alcohol, \ndrugs, or injury to a person or property.\nIf you are not able to obtain certified copies of any court disposition relating to Items 10.A. - 10.D. , please submit all \nthree items below:\n• A written explanation on government letterhead from the custodian of the documents of why the documents are \nnot available, unless the documents are generally unavailable from the custodian of the document; \n• A written statement from the applicant that explains why the record is not available and describes the criminal \ncharge, arrest, or conviction; the final outcome or disposition; and any rehabilitation completed (including, but \nnot limited to, compliance with court-mandated conditions (such as parole, probation, counseling, or payments), \nnot violating any laws, and making an effort to positively contribute to your community since your last arrest or \nconviction); and\n• Any other secondary evidence that shows the disposition of the criminal case; or if secondary evidence is also \nnot available, one or more written statements, signed under penalty of perjury under 28 U.S.C. section 1746 by \nsomeone other than the applicant, who has direct personal knowledge of the disposition of the criminal case.\n11.

Special confidentiality protections (described at 8 U.S.C. section 1367) apply to \nyou as a human trafficking victim. 8 U.S.C. section 1367 provides two forms of critical protection for human trafficking victims. The first form of protection is a prohibition on adverse determinations against the victim based on information provided solely by their abuser and other prohibited sources. The second form of protection is a prohibition on disclosure \nof any information about the victim to third parties, except in certain very limited circumstances. \nIf you are a derivative applicant, you may file Form I-485 at the same time as or after the principal applicant has filed \nForm I-485.\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 25 of 42\nYou must file your Form I-485 with USCIS, even if you are in removal proceedings in Immigration Court.

In \naddition to the evidence listed in the main instructions, principal and derivative applicants must also submit:\n1. Evidence you were lawfully admitted in T nonimmigrant status and continue to hold such status at the time you file \nForm I-485; and\n2. Evidence that adjustment of status is warranted as a matter of discretion.\nIn addition, principal applicants must submit:\n1. Evidence of continuous physical presence;\n2.

Your own affidavit attesting to your continuous physical presence.\nNOTE:  If you do not have documentation to establish continuous physical presence, you must explain why in an affidavit \nand provide additional affidavits from others with firsthand knowledge who can attest to your continuous physical \npresence with specific facts. Your affidavit alone is not sufficient to show continuous physical presence.\nNOTE:  Generally, if you departed from the United States for any trip that lasted longer than 90 days or for multiple trips \nthat together exceeded 180 days, you failed to maintain continuous physical presence unless you can establish that:\n• Your absence was necessary to assist in the investigation or prosecution of acts of trafficking; or\n• An official involved in the investigation or prosecution of acts of trafficking certifies that the absence was otherwise \njustified.\nNOTE:  If you have less than three years of continuous physical presence since you were admitted as a T-1 nonimmigrant, \nyou must submit a document signed by the Attorney General of the United States (or designee) stating that the \ninvestigation or prosecution is complete.\nEvidence of Good Moral Character\nBefore USCIS can approve your application, USCIS must find that you are a person of good moral character according to \nINA section 101(f) since first being admitted as a T-1 nonimmigrant and during the pendency of your Form I-485.\nIn order to demonstrate good moral character, you must submit:\n1. Your own affidavit attesting to your good moral character; and\n2. A local police clearance or a state-issued criminal background check from each locality or state in the United States in \nwhich you have resided for six or more months while you were in T-1 nonimmigrant status.

However, if there is reason \nto believe that you may lack good moral character, USCIS may require evidence of good moral character.\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 27 of 42\nEvidence of Compliance with Reasonable Requests for Assistance in the Investigation or Prosecution OR Evidence \nThat You Were Under 18 Years of Age at the Time of the Victimization OR Evidence That You Were Unable to \nCooperate with a Reasonable Request for Assistance Due to Trauma OR Evidence of Extreme Hardship Involving \nUnusual and Severe Harm\nYou must submit evidence that shows you:\n1. Complied with any reasonable request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of acts of trafficking;\n2. Were under 18 years of age at the time of the victimization that qualified you for T nonimmigrant status;\n3. Were unable to cooperate with a reasonable request for assistance due to trauma; or\n4. Would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm if removed from the United States.\nEvidence of Compliance with Reasonable Requests for Assistance\nEvidence that you continue to comply with any reasonable request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of \ntrafficking in persons includes, but is not limited to:\n1. Your own affidavit describing how you continue to comply with any reasonable requests;\n2. A statement from a Federal, state, Tribal, or local law enforcement official describing how you complied with any \nreasonable requests;\n3. A re-signed and dated Form I-914, Supplement B;\n4. Trial transcripts;\n5. Court documents;\n6. Police reports; and\n7. News articles.\nIf you assisted law enforcement when you received your T-1 nonimmigrant status and are no longer assisting law \nenforcement, you should describe in a written statement why you are no longer providing assistance. Reasons may \ninclude, but are not limited to:\n1. The investigation or prosecution is complete;\n2. Your T-1 nonimmigrant status is based on your willingness to assist, but you were not needed, and you continue to be \nwilling to assist, but your assistance is still not needed;\n3. You were not asked to assist after being granted T-1 nonimmigrant status; or\n4. A request for assistance was not reasonable (See 8 CFR Section 214.208(c) for more information). \nUSCIS may consult the Attorney General of the United States if appropriate.\nNOTE:  If you were not required to comply with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution \nwhen you received your T-1 nonimmigrant status (because you were under 18 years of age or suffered trauma at the time \nof victimization that excepted or exempted you from the compliance requirement), you should include an affidavit stating \nthat you were not subject to the compliance requirement.\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 28 of 42\nEvidence of Extreme Hardship Involving Unusual and Severe Harm\nAlternatively, you may also submit evidence that you will suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm if \nyou are removed from the United States. Proving extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm requires you to meet a higher standard of proof than other extreme hardship standards in immigration law . \n The extreme hardship cannot \nbe based on current or future economic harm, or the lack of or disruption to social or economic opportunities. USCIS may consider both traditional extreme hardship factors and the factors associated with having been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as well as relevant country condition reports or any other public or private sources of information. Hardship to persons other than you will only be considered in determining whether you would suffer the requisite hardship if the evidence demonstrates specifically that you will suffer extreme hardship upon removal as a result of hardship to someone else. See 8 CFR 214.209 for a list of factors.\nYou should include evidence to document all factors that are relevant to you. However, if the basis of your current extreme \nhardship claim is a continuation of the extreme hardship claimed in your application for T-1 nonimmigrant status, you do not need to re-document the entire claim. Instead, submit evidence to establish that your previously established extreme hardship is ongoing.\nNOTE: USCIS is not bound by any previous extreme hardship determination.\nDiscretion\nAdjustment of status based on T nonimmigrant status is not an automatic benefit, so you bear the burden of showing that \nUSCIS should use its discretion to approve your adjustment of status application. When making a discretionary decision \non your application, USCIS may consider all factors.\nIf you answered “Yes” to any question in Part 9. General Eligibility and Inadmissibility Grounds, and any of the \nacts or circumstances relate to you having been a victim of a severe form of trafficking, include a detailed description of \nhow your victimization relates to the inadmissibility ground(s). USCIS may consider all factors, including those acts that would otherwise make you inadmissible.\nGenerally, favorable factors such as family ties, hardship, and length of residence in the United States, may be sufficient \nfor USCIS to use its discretion to approve your application. However , when adverse factors are present in your case, you \nmay offset these by submitting supporting documentation of favorable factors you wish USCIS to consider . See 8 CFR \n245.23(e)(3).\nCrime Victim (U Nonimmigrant, Form I-918), Derivative Family Member (Form I-918A), or Qualifying Family Member (Form I-929)\nYou may apply to adjust status under INA section 245(m) if:\n• You were admitted to the United States in U nonimmigrant status; \n• You maintained continuous physical presence for the required period of time; and \n• You have complied with reasonable requests to assist law enforcement authorities in the investigation or prosecution of qualifying criminal activity. \nYou must file your Form I-485 with USCIS, even if you are in removal proceedings in Immigration Court. USCIS has exclusive jurisdiction over adjustment of status applications filed under INA  section 245(m). \nSpecial protections (described at 8 U.S.C. 1367) apply to you as a U nonimmigrant (victim of a qualifying criminal activity). The first form of protection is a prohibition on adverse determinations against you based on information provided solely by the perpetrator of the qualifying criminal activity and other prohibited sources. The second form of \nprotection is a prohibition on disclosure of any information about you to third parties, except in certain very limited circumstances.\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 29 of 42\nIf you need to notify us of your change of address, please follow the special instructions provided for V AWA/T/U cases at \nwww.uscis.gov/addresschange .\nBoth principal and derivative applicants may file Form I-485 only after they have been physically present in the United \nStates for a continuous period of at least three years since being admitted as a U nonimmigrant. Applicants must continue \nto be physically present through the date that USCIS makes a decision on this application.\nAdditionally, certain qualifying family members may also apply for adjustment of status. Your approved Form I-929, \nPetition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant, confirms that you are a qualifying family member who \nmay file Form I-485. You must also show that the qualifying family relationship that formed the basis of your Form I-929 \napproval exists at the time the principal applicant (U-1 nonimmigrant) becomes a lawful permanent resident and continues \nto exist until USCIS makes a decision on your Form I-485.\nAdditional Evidence Requirements\nAs a U nonimmigrant, you must submit evidence showing you meet certain requirements specific to this category . In \naddition to the evidence listed in the main instructions, principal and derivative applicants must also submit:\n1. Evidence you were lawfully admitted in U nonimmigrant status and continue to hold such status at the time you file \nForm I-485; \n2. Evidence of continuous physical presence; and\n3. Evidence that adjustment of status is warranted as a matter of discretion.\n4. In addition, principal applicants must submit evidence that they complied with reasonable requests for assistance in \nthe investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity .\nEvidence of Continuous Physical Presence\nYou do not need to submit documentation showing that you were present in the United States on every single day of the \nthree-year U nonimmigrant status period, but you should not have significant chronological gaps in your documentation.\nTo show continuous physical presence, you must submit the evidence listed in Item Numbers 1. - 4.  below:\n1. Copies of every page of your passports or equivalent travel documents (or valid explanation of why you do not have \nsuch a document);\n2. Documentation of any departure from, and return to, the United States while in U nonimmigrant status, including:\nA. Date of departure; \nB. Place of departure; \nC. Length of departure;\nD.

A list of the type and date of documents already contained in your DHS file that establishes physical presence, \nsuch as, but not limited to, a written copy of a sworn statement given to a DHS officer , a document from the \nlaw enforcement agency attesting to the fact that you have continued to comply with requests for assistance, the \ntranscript of a formal hearing, and Form I-213, Record of Deportable-Inadmissible Alien; and\n4. Your own affidavit attesting to your continuous physical presence.\nNOTE: If you do not have documentation to establish continuous physical presence, you must explain why in an affidavit \nand provide additional affidavits from others with firsthand knowledge who can attest to your continuous physical \npresence with specific facts. Your affidavit alone is not sufficient to show continuous physical presence.\nFailure to Maintain Continuous Physical Presence\nGenerally, you have failed to maintain continuous physical presence if you departed from the United States for any \ntrip that lasted longer than 90 days or for multiple trips that together exceeded 180 days. To show that you maintained \ncontinuous physical presence despite taking these trips, you must submit a certification from the agency that signed Form \nI-918, Supplement B, in support of your U nonimmigrant status stating that:\n1. Your absence was necessary in order to assist in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity; or\n2. Your absence was otherwise justified.\nEvidence of Compliance with Reasonable Requests for Assistance in the Investigation or Prosecution of the \nQualifying Criminal Activity\nYou are required to provide ongoing assistance, as needed, to law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation or \nprosecution of the qualifying criminal activity. 8 CFR 245.24(a)(5) defines “refusal to provide assistance in a criminal \ninvestigation or prosecution” as a refusal by the U nonimmigrant to provide assistance to a law enforcement agency or \nofficial that had responsibility for the investigation or prosecution of persons in connection with the qualifying criminal \nactivity after being granted U nonimmigrant status.\nTo show you have met this requirement, you must submit evidence that, from the time you filed for U nonimmigrant status \nuntil you file Form I-485, you have complied with (or did not unreasonably refuse to comply with) reasonable requests \nfor assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity . You are required to provide ongoing \nassistance until USCIS adjudicates your Form I-485.\nThe evidence may include:\n1. A newly executed Form I-918, Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification;\n2. A photocopy of the original Form I-918, Supplement B, with a new date and signature from the certifying agency;\n3. Documentation on official letterhead from the certifying agency stating that you have not unreasonably refused to \ncooperate in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity;\n4. An affidavit describing any efforts you made to obtain a newly executed Form I-918, Supplement B, or other \nevidence describing whether you received any requests to provide assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the \nqualifying criminal activity, and your response to these requests; or\n5. Court documents, police reports, news articles, copies of reimbursement forms for travel to and from court, and \naffidavits of other witnesses or officials.\nIf you submit an affidavit, it must include:\n1. A description of all instances when you were requested to provide assistance in the investigation or prosecution of \npersons in connection with the qualifying criminal activity after you were granted U nonimmigrant status and how \nyou responded to such requests;\n2. Any identifying information you have about the law enforcement personnel involved in the case;\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 31 of 42\n3. Any information you have about the status of the investigation or prosecution, including any char ges filed and the \noutcome of any proceedings, or whether the investigation or prosecution was dropped and the reasons why; and\n4. If you have refused a request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution, you must provide a detailed \nexplanation of why you refused to comply with requests for assistance and why you believed that the requests for assistance were unreasonable.\nNOTE: In certain cases, this requirement of ongoing assistance may require someone other than the principal applicant to provide evidence to USCIS. For example, in some U nonimmigrant cases, the U-1 petitioner was a child (or was incompetent or incapacitated) and was not directly required to provide the assistance in an investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity. In these cases, someone other than the child, such as a parent, guardian, or next friend provided the assistance. This person may need to provide evidence of continued assistance (or evidence that there was no unreasonable refusal to comply) with an investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity .\nDiscretion\nAdjustment of status based on U nonimmigrant status is not an automatic benefit, so you bear the burden of showing that \nUSCIS should use its discretion to approve your adjustment of status application. When making a discretionary decision \non your application, USCIS may consider all factors, including those acts that would otherwise make you inadmissible.\nGenerally, favorable factors such as family ties, hardship, and length of residence in the United States, may be sufficient \nfor USCIS to use its discretion to approve your application. However , when adverse factors are present in your case, you \nmay offset these by submitting supporting documentation of favorable factors you wish USCIS to consider . See 8 CFR \n245.24(d)(11).\nAdditional Instructions for Asylees and Refugees\nAsylum Status\nIf you are an asylee, you may be eligible to adjust status under INA  section 209(b) if you have been physically present \nin the United States for one year after your grant of asylum, your status has not been terminated, you are not firmly resettled in any foreign country, and you still meet the definition of refugee found in INA section 101(a)(42)(A) or are the spouse or child of such an asylee.

Other foreign nationals whose \nimmigration status authorizes them to work in the United States without restrictions may also use Form I-765 to apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an EAD that shows such authorization.  Review the Who May \nFile Form I-765  section of these Instructions to determine whether you should use Form I-765.\nForeign nationals may also apply for a Social Security number and card on Form I-765 following the guidelines in the Specific Instructions section of these Instructions, Part 2. Information About You, Item Numbers 13.a. - 17.b.\nIf you are a lawful permanent resident, a conditional permanent resident, or a nonimmigrant only authorized for employment with a specific employer under 8 CFR 274a.12(b), do not use Form I-765.\nDefinitions\nEmployment Authorization Document (EAD):  The EAD is the card (also known as Form I-688A, Form I-688B, Form \nI-766, or any successor document) issued as evidence that the holder is authorized to work in the United States.\nInitial EAD:  An EAD issued to an eligible applicant for the first time under a specific eligibility category .\nRenewal EAD:  An EAD issued to an eligible applicant after the expiration of a previous EAD issued under the same \ncategory.\nReplacement EAD:  An EAD issued to an eligible applicant when the previously issued EAD was lost, stolen, damaged, \nor contains errors, such as a misspelled name.\nNOTE:  For more information regarding employment authorization documents, visit www.uscis.gov/greencard/\nemployment-authorization-document.\nWho May File Form I-765?\nYou may file Form I-765 if you fall within one of the eligibility categories below.  For some categories, employment \nauthorization is granted with your underlying immigration status (called “incident to status” employment authorization).  For example, asylees and refugees have employment authorization as soon as they obtain such status.  In these cases, your EAD is issued upon approval of your Form I-765, and the EAD is evidence of your employment authorization.  For other categories such as parolees or individuals with deferred action, USCIS must first approve your Form I-765 before you are eligible to accept employment in the United States.  Once your Form I-765 is approved, USCIS will issue your EAD.  You \nmust type or print your eligibility category in Part 2., \nItem Number 27., on Form I-765.  Enter only one category number \non the application.  For example, if you are a refugee applying for an EAD, type or print “(a)(3)” in Item Number 27.\nPlease note that a person with a pending application for an immigration benefit or request might have a different category number than the person who was already granted the benefit or request.  For example certain pending asylum applicants are category “(c)(8),” but a person already granted asylum is category “(a)(5).”Instructions for Application for Employment Authorization\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Ser vicesUSCIS\n Form I-765\nOMB No. 1615-0040\nExpires 09/30/2027\n\nForm I-765 Instructions   01/20/25   Page 2 of 25\nAsylee/Refugee Categories (and their Spouses and Children)\n1.

When a conditional permanent resident’s status \nis within 90 days of expiration, the conditional permanent resident is ineligible for a replacement conditional resident card and must file a petition to remove the conditions, as follows: \n1.If you became a conditional permanent resident through marriage to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, and\nyour two-year conditional permanent resident status is expiring within the next 90 days, file Form I-751, Petition toRemove Conditions on Residence; or\n2.If you became a conditional permanent resident based on the creation of a new commercial enterprise and a financialinvestment in the United States, and your conditional permanent resident status is expiring within the next 90 days,file Form I-829, Petition by Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions.\nUpon receipt of your properly filed Forms I-751 or I-829, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shall extend your conditional permanent resident status automatically, if necessary, until such time as USCIS has adjudicated the petition.

USCIS will automatically extend the validity of your Permanent Resident Card (commonly called a Green Card) for up to 24 months after you properly apply for naturalization.

We will send you a request for physical photographs with instructions on how to submit them.\nAttorney or representative\n: You may be represented, at no expense to the U.S. government, by an attorney or other duly authorized or accredited representative. Your representative must submit\nForm G-28, Notice of Entry of Appearance as Attorney or Accredited Representative\n, with your Form N-400.

If you lose your Green Card, you generally must still file Form I-90 even if you have applied for naturalization. If you have a Form N-400 receipt notice that automatically extends the validity of your Green Card, but your notice has been destroyed or lost, then you generally must file Form I-90 to renew your expiring Green Card.\nBiometrics for Service Members\nWe will review your application and conduct required background and security checks, which may include you providing us with your fingerprints.

Avoid highlighting, crossing out, or typing or printing outside the area provided for a response.  If you must make substantial corrections to your Form N-400, USCIS recommends that you start a new Form N-400 rather than using correction tape or fluid to correct the information.

Provide your A-Number (if any), on the top right corner of each page.  Your A-Number is located on your Permanent Resident Card (Green Card, formerly known as the Alien Registration Card).  The A-Number on your card consists of a seven- to nine-digit number, depending on when your record was created.  If the A-Number on your card has fewer than nine digits, place enough zeros before the first number to make a total of nine digits on Form N-400.  For example, type or print number A1234567 as A001234567 or type or print number A12345678 as A012345678.

For those petitioners that wish to be considered for the fee exemption and whose Afghan national relative was not born in Afghanistan, you cannot submit your petition online. You must complete a\npaper version of Form I-130\nand follow the instructions for filing the Form I-130 by mail (paper).\nUse this form if you (the petitioner) are a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national and you need to establish your qualifying relationship with an\neligible relative\n(the beneficiary) who wishes to come to or stay in the United States permanently and apply for the Permanent Resident Card (also called a Green Card).\nYou must select only 1 option for Part 4 (Question 61 or 62)\nto indicate whether the beneficiary will seek adjustment of status inside the United States or consular processing abroad.\nDo not complete both questions, and do not leave this section blank.\nFile Online\nProcessing Information\nSubmitting\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n, is the first step to help an eligible relative apply to immigrate to the United States and apply for a Green Card. The filing or approval of this petition does not give your relative any immigration status or benefit.\nWe will generally approve your Form I-130 if you can establish a qualifying relationship between you and your relative that allows them to immigrate to the United States.

However, if your relative qualifies as an immediate relative, an immigrant visa is always available.\nIf your relative is already in the United States but they are not eligible to apply for the Green Card by filing Form I-485, the relative may be eligible to apply for an immigrant visa with the U.S. Department of State at a U.S. embassy or consulate through consular processing.

If your self-petition is approved and you meet other eligibility requirements, you may be eligible to apply to become a lawful permanent resident. For more information, see the\nQuestions and Answers: Abused Spouses, Children and Parents Under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)\n, and\nGreen Card for VAWA Self-Petitioner\nwebpages.\nWidow(er)s of Deceased U.S. Citizens\nAt one time, section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act said a citizen’s surviving spouse could file an immigrant visa petition if the citizen and surviving spouse had been married at least 2 years. On Oct. 28, 2009, section 568(c) of Pub. L. 111-83 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act so that you may be eligible to immigrate, even if you and your deceased spouse were married for less than 2 years when your spouse died. However, you must still file your Form I-360\nno later than 2 years after your spouse’s death\n.\nYour eligibility for classification as the widow(er) of a U.S. citizen based on a Form I-360 that you file after your citizen spouse died, ends if you remarry before you immigrate or adjust status.\nIf your deceased citizen spouse filed a\nForm I-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n, before they died, you do not need to file a Form I-360 because we automatically converted your spouse’s Form I-130 to a Form I-360. If your immigrant visa petition was originally filed as a Form I-130, your remarriage does not necessarily mean you cannot immigrate. Section 204(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows us to approve the petition as a Form I-130, even if you have remarried.\nFurther guidance can be found in the Form I-360 instructions and on the\nWidow(er)\nwebpage.\nOther classifications not listed above may be eligible to use Form I-360. Please refer to the form instructions for more information regarding eligibility and when to file.\nFiling Fee\nYou can find the fees for Form I-360 by visiting our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nYou can pay the fees by\ncredit card\nor debit card using\nForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions\n, or by\nACH transaction\nusing\nForm G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions\n. We will also accept a money order, personal check, or cashier’s check. If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nWhen you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request.\nIf you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our\nFee Calculator\nto help determine your fee.\nIf you are submitting multiple forms, pay each fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.\nIf you are required to pay a fee for your petition or are unable to submit your petition electronically, you may still follow the form instructions and submit the Form I-360 by mail.\nNote:\nOn July 18, 2025, USCIS\nannounced\nnew fees required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill.

      "instructions": "Instructions for Petition to Classify Orphan \nas an Immediate Relative\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration ServicesUSCIS\n Form I-600\nOMB No. 1615-0028\nExpires 10/31/2027  \n  \n \n \n What Is the Purpose of Form I-600? \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) uses the information provided on Form I-600, Petition to Classify \nOrphan as an Immediate Relative, to determine whether a child who has been or will be adopted by a U.S. citizen (and spouse, if married) can be classified as an orphan for an immediate relative immigrant visa. \nWho May File Form I-600? \nIf you are a U.S. citizen, you (and your spouse, if married) may file Form I-600 for an unmarried child if: \n1. You file the Form I-600 before the child’s 16th birthday (or before the child’s 18th birthday in some cases, as \ndiscussed in these Instructions); \n2. The child’s adoption is not governed by the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention); \n3. The child qualifies as an orphan, as defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 101(b)(1)(F); and \n4. You (and your spouse, if married) either: \nA. Have adopted the child outside the United States and the adoption order is final; or \nB. Have obtained legal custody of the child for emigration and adoption in the United States and will adopt the child \nin the United States after the child enters the country with a visa. \nTo qualify as an adoption for immigration purposes, the adoption must, according to the laws where it takes place, establish a permanent legal parent-child relationship between the child and you (and your spouse, if married), as well as terminate the legal parent-child relationship between the child and any former parent(s). \nIf you do not have a final adoption, you may still be eligible to file this petition if you have legal custody of the child for \nthe purposes of emigration and adoption. For example a guardianship order, foster parent appointment, or other custody order may be sufficient if it permits you to take the child out of the country for the purpose of finalizing the adoption in the United States or in another country. \nWho May Not File Form I-600? \nIf the child is already in the United States, you may not file Form I-600 unless that child is a parolee and has not been adopted in the United States. \nIf the child does not qualify as an orphan under INA section 101(b)(1)(F), you cannot file Form I-600. However, the child may qualify as an immediate relative under INA section 101(b)(1)(E) and you may be able to file Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative. See Form I-130 and its Instructions for additional information about this alternative. \nIf the child’s adoption is governed by the Hague Adoption Convention, you generally cannot file Form I-600 for the child. \nIf you seek to adopt a child who is a habitual resident in a country that is a party to the Hague Adoption Convention, \nor you have already adopted a child on or after the date the child’ s country became a party to the Hague Adoption \nConvention, you should generally file Form I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country, and Form I-800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative. \nForm I-600 Instructions 01/20/25 Page 1 of 14\n\nForm I-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 2 of 14 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n There are three exceptions. You may be able to file Form I-600 if: \n1. You (and your spouse, if married) were not yet U.S. citizens when you adopted the child, but the petitioner is a U.S. \ncitizen at the time of filing Form I-600; \n2. The child’s adoption is not governed by the Hague Adoption Convention, even though it occurred after the Hague Adoption Convention entered into force. For example, the case meets requirements agreed upon by the United States and the child’s country of origin to proceed as a non-Convention case during a country’s transition to the Hague process; or \n3. The child’s adoption is not governed by the Hague Adoption Convention because it occurred before the Hague Adoption Convention entered into force in the child’s country of origin. For additional information, see the adoption-related pages on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption and the Department of State’s website at \nwww.state.gov/family-law/. \nNOTE: If you are filing under one of these exceptions, you should include evidence that you qualify for the exception with your Form I-600. \nFor a list of Hague Adoption Convention countries and the dates the Hague Adoption Convention became effective for \neach country, see the Status Table on the website of The Hague Conference on Private International Law at https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status-table/?cid=69. \nWhat Are the Eligibility Requirements? \n1. Eligibility requirements for a child. \nUnder INA section 101(b)(1)(F), an orphan is a child who has: A. No parents because of the death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by , or separation or loss from both \nparents; or \nB. A sole or surviving parent who is incapable of providing the child with proper care and has, in writing, irrevocably \nreleased the child for emigration and adoption. \nSpecific age requirements apply. Even if you have not yet completed the adoption or obtained all of the required supporting documentation, you MUST file Form I-600 before the child turns 16 years of age unless one of the \nfollowing exceptions applies: \nA. Sibling Exception. You may file Form I-600 after the child’s 16th birthday, but before the child’s 18th birthday, \nonly if the child is the birth sibling of another foreign born child (“other sibling”) who has immigrated (or will immigrate) based on an adoption by the same adoptive parent(s). If the other sibling immigrates as an orphan, then the Form I-600 for the other sibling must have been filed before that sibling’ s 16th birthday. If the other \nsibling immigrates as an adopted child under INA 101(b)(1)(E), rather than as an orphan, the actual adoption must have occurred before that sibling’s 16th birthday; or \nB. Form I-600A Filed When a Child is 15 Years of Age. If you have filed Form I-600A, USCIS will deem the Form I-600A filing date to be the Form I-600 filing date if: \n(1) You filed Form I-600A after the child’s 15th birthday, but before the child’s 16th birthday (or, if applicable for \na birth sibling, after the child’s 17th birthday, but before the child’s 18th birthday); AND \n(2) You filed Form I-600 no more than 180 days after the initial approval of Form I-600A. \n2. Eligibility requirements for parents. \nYou must be a U.S. citizen to file Form I-600. \nIf you are married, your spouse does not need to be a U.S. citizen. However , if your spouse lives in the United States, \nyou must submit proof that your spouse is living in the United States lawfully as a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, lawful \npermanent resident, or in another lawful immigration status.\n\nForm I-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 3 of 14 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If you are unmarried, you must be at least 25 years of age to file Form I-600. \n3. Eligibility requirements for adoption abroad - child adopted by both parents and seen in person by at least one \nadoptive parent. \nIf the child was adopted abroad, you must establish that either you or your spouse (if married) personally saw and \nobserved the child before or during the adoption proceedings in order for the adoption to be considered full and final. If you are married, you and your spouse do not both need to have personally seen and observed the child. However , \nthe adoption decree must show that you and your spouse adopted the child jointly. \nIf you previously filed Form I-600A and your responses on this petition differ from the responses provided on your \nForm I-600A, USCIS may request additional information regarding the responses. \n4. Eligibility requirements for adoption abroad - child not seen by at least one parent or not adopted by both parents. \nIf the child was adopted abroad, but neither you nor your spouse (if married) personally saw and observed the child \nbefore or during the adoption proceedings, the child will be considered to be coming to the United States for adoption. You will then need to either adopt the child anew in your state of residence or take whatever steps may be required by your state of residence to recognize the foreign adoption. \nAlso, if you are married and you and your spouse did not jointly adopt the child abroad, the child will be considered to \nbe coming to the United States for adoption, and the spouse who did not adopt abroad will need to adopt the child in the United States. \n5. Pre-adoption eligibility requirements when a child is coming to the United States for adoption. \nIf the child has not been adopted abroad (for example, you only obtained legal custody or guardianship for emigration \nand adoption in the United States), or if the child will be considered to be coming to the United States for adoption, you and your spouse (if married) must establish that: \nA. You and your spouse will adopt the child in the United States; and \nB. Any pre-adoption requirements of the state of the orphan’s proposed residence in the United States have been met \nor will be met at a later time. \nCombination Form I-600 Filing \nIn some situations, you can file your Form I-600 petition on behalf of a specific child together with the supporting documents for Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of an Orphan Petition, to request that USCIS decide your suitability and eligibility to adopt at the same time as the child’ s eligibility. This is referred to as combination filing. \nYou do not need to file a separate Form I-600A in this situation. \nYou may use this combination filing option if you: 1. Have not previously filed Form I-600A, but you have finalized an adoption or obtained legal custody of a child; \n2. Have identified a child you would like to adopt and your previously approved Form I-600A  expired before you filed a \nForm I-600 petition; or \n3. Previously filed Form I-600A, but your marital status changed after the Form I-600A  was approved, and you have \nfinalized an adoption or obtained legal custody of a child.\n\nForm I-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 4 of 14 \n   \n \n  \n General Instructions \nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

For this supplement, an adult member of the household is any individual other than you and your spouse (if married), who has the same residence as you and is 18 years of age or older on or before the date that you file Form I-600A or Form I-600. An adult member of the household is considered to have the same residence as you if they actually live with you. It does not matter if they intend to reside with you for a short term or long term. \nUSCIS may request that you submit Supplement 1 for any household member who has not yet turned 18 years of age \nbefore you file Form I-600A or Form I-600, or who does not actually live with you but whose presence USCIS deems relevant to whether you and your spouse (if married) are suitable and eligible to adopt. \nForm I-600A/I-600, Supplement 2, Consent to Disclose Information \nIf you want to give consent for USCIS to disclose information about your case to your primary adoption service provider, \nhome study preparer, or any other individual or entity (other than your attorney or accredited representative), you should complete Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 2. You are not required to give this consent in order to file Form I-600. \nForm I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3, Request for Action on Approved Form I-600A/I-600 \nYou must file Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3 if you would like to request action, such as: • An extension or updated suitability determination, on your approved and valid Form I-600A; or \n• An updated suitability determination on your approved Form I-600 (combination filing). \nOnce you file Form I-600, you are not required to keep any underlying Form I-600A  approval valid, but you may do so if \nyou wish. If your Form I-600A approval is still valid,  you must use Form I-600A/Form I-600, Supplement 3, regardless of \nwhether you have filed Form I-600, to request any of the following: 1. A first extension of your approved Form I-600A; \n2. A second or subsequent extension of your approved Form I-600A; \n3. A new approval notice based on a significant change or change in the number of children or characteristics (such as \nage, sex, and/or special needs) of the child or children you intend to adopt after your Form I-600A or Form I-600 was approved; \n4. A first change to a new non-Hague Adoption Convention country; \n5. A second or subsequent change to a new non-Hague Adoption Convention country; or \n6. A duplicate approval notice. \nYou must submit an updated home study if there are any changes or if you are requesting an extension. \nYour Form I-600A approval notice indicates the date your approval expires. If you are filing Supplement 3 to obtain an \nextension of your approved Form I-600A, you must do so before your approval expires, but no more than 90 days before its expiration.\n\nForm I-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 8 of 14 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n NOTE: You may not use Supplement 3 to extend eligibility to process your case as a Hague Adoption Convention \ntransition case beyond your first extension. Generally, you may not use Supplement 3 to increase the number of children \nyou wish to adopt from a transition country. However, unless prohibited by the new Convention country, USCIS will permit prospective adoptive parent(s) to request an updated Form I-600A approval notice to increase the number of children they are approved to adopt as a transition case only to pursue the adoption of a birth sibling, provided the birth sibling(s) is (are) identified and the Form I-600 petition is filed before the Form I-600A  approval expires. You may not use \nSupplement 3 to change to a transition country if you have already designated a country . See the adoption-related pages on \nthe USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption for information on filing limitations in transition cases. \nInitial Evidence \nUnless otherwise stated, you must submit the following supporting documentation with your Form I-600: \nIf you are seeking to file Form I-600 for a child that is 15 years of age, see the What Are the Eligibility Requirements \nsection of these Instructions. 1.

If your spouse is a U.S. citizen or non-citizen U.S. national, you must submit the evidence listed above as proof of your spouse’s U.S. citizenship or non-citizen U.S. national status. If your spouse is a foreign national who is residing in the United States, submit proof of your spouse’s lawful immigration status, such as a Permanent Resident Card (Green Card); Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record; a copy of the \nbiographic pages of your spouse’s passport and his or her nonimmigrant visa pages showing an admission stamp; or any other Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-issued document. \n2. Proof of Marriage of Petitioner and Spouse (if applicable) \nIf you are married, you must submit a copy of your marriage certificate. If you or your spouse were previously married, you must also submit proof of termination of any prior marriages. However , if you previously submitted any \nof this evidence with a pending or approved and valid Form I-600A, you do not need to submit it again unless USCIS requests it. \nIf any change occurs in your marital status while your petition is pending, immediately notify the USCIS office or the \ngovernment entity that USCIS designates as having jurisdiction over your case. See the Home Study Updates section \nof these Instructions below for more details on changes in marital status. \n3. Proof of Orphan’s Age and Identity \nSubmit a copy of the orphan’s birth certificate, or if such a certificate is not available, an explanation together with \nother proof of age and identity. Secondary evidence can include medical records, school records, religious records, entry in a family Bible, orphanage intake sheets, or affidavits from individuals with first-hand knowledge of the event(s) to which they are testifying. If there is doubt that the child is the birth child of his or her purported birth parent, USCIS may allow you to submit DNA evidence to establish the claimed relationship. \n4. Copies of Death Certificates of Child’s Parents (if applicable) \n5. Certified Copy of Adoption or Custody Decree and Certified Translation (if applicable) \nSome orphan countries follow the Pre-Adoption Immigration Review (PAIR) process. In such countries, you must \nfile Form I-600 and obtain a PAIR letter before adopting or obtaining legal custody for emigration and adoption in the United States. For a list of such countries, see the adoption-related pages on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption. \n6. Evidence Child is an Orphan (as defined in INA section 101(b)(1)(F) and 8 CFR 204.3(b)) \nYou must submit evidence that: A. The child’s birth mother is a sole parent who is incapable of providing proper care for the child and has in writing \nirrevocably released the child for emigration and adoption. A birth father of an orphan cannot be classified as a \nsole parent under 8 CFR 204.3(b); \nB. One of the child’s birth parents is deceased, and the surviving parent is incapable of providing proper care for the \nchild and has in writing irrevocably released the child for emigration and adoption; or \nC. The child has no legal parents due to the death or disappearance of, abandonment or desertion by, or separation \nor loss from both parents. These terms are defined in 8 CFR 204.3(b) and indicate what must be established for each of these situations to apply. It is not necessary to establish that each parent is absent for the same reason. For example, if one parent has disappeared and the other parent has abandoned the child, the child may qualify as an orphan. \nBefore USCIS, or the government entity that USCIS designates, can make a final decision on your petition, an \nofficer must complete an internal document called Form I-604, Determination on Child for Adoption, also known \nas an orphan determination. USCIS, or the government entity that USCIS designates, must complete an orphan determination as part of every orphan adoption case to verify that the child is an orphan under U.S. immigration law.\n\nForm I-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 10 of 14 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7. Proof of Compliance with Preadoption Requirements (if any) \nIf the child will be coming to the United States for adoption, you must provide evidence that any pre-adoption \nrequirements of the state where the child will live have been met or will be met. If you cannot submit this evidence when you initially file your petition due to state law requirements, you may submit this evidence later . However, \nUSCIS will not approve your Form I-600 for a specific child without this evidence. \n8. Home Study \nIf you previously submitted your home study to USCIS with your pending or approved and valid Form I-600A or \nForm I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3, you do not need to resubmit a copy of it with your Form I-600. However, you \nmust submit a home study with your Form I-600 if you did not previously submit it with your Form I-600A or Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3, or if you are requesting a suitability and eligibility determination as part of Form I-600. The only exception to this requirement is if you live in a state where an appropriate state authority must review and approve your home study and submit it directly to USCIS. In all cases, your home study must not be more than six months old when it is submitted to USCIS. If it is more than six months old, you must include an update that is not more than six months old. \nYou must submit a home study prepared according to the requirements specified in 8 CFR 204.311 by a person who is \nauthorized under 22 CFR 96 to prepare the home study. \nA home study preparer is an individual or agency authorized to conduct home studies, as a public domestic \nauthority, a public foreign authority, an accredited agency, approved person, supervised provider, or exempted \nprovider (see 8 CFR 204.301). The home study preparer (other than a public domestic authority or a public foreign authority) must hold any license or other authorization that is required to conduct adoption home studies under the law of the jurisdiction where the home study is prepared. The home study preparer (or, if the home study is prepared by an entity, the officer or employee who has authority to sign the home study for the entity) must also personally sign your home study and any updated home study under penalty of perjury under U.S. law. \nIf your case meets certain criteria, your home study may be required to meet some different requirements than those \ndescribed above. For more information, see the information on the Intercountry Adoption Universal Accreditation Act of 2012 on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption. \nIf your home study was not conducted by an accredited agency, an accredited agency must review and approve the \nhome study before you submit it to USCIS. This requirement does not apply to a home study that was conducted by a public domestic authority or a public foreign authority. A public domestic authority means an authority operated by a state, local, or tribal government within the United States. A public foreign authority means an authority operated by a national or subnational government of a foreign country. Although a reviewer is not required, a home study conducted by a public foreign authority or public domestic authority must still comply with the requirements specified in 8 CFR 204.311. \nHome Study Requirements \nFor a complete description of the requirements for a home study, see 8 CFR 204.311 and 22 CFR 96. If your case meets certain criteria, your home study may not be required to meet the requirements of 8 CFR 204.31 1 and 22 CFR 96. For \nmore information, see the information on the Intercountry Adoption Universal Accreditation Act of 2012 on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption. \nHome Study Updates \nThere may be times during the adoption process when you will be required to obtain and provide an update of your home \nstudy. \nThe following are some examples of circumstances that require a home study update:\n\nForm I-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 11 of 14 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n 1. If you previously filed Form I-600A, you must submit an updated home study to USCIS when you request an \nextension of your Form I-600A approval. \n2. Change to a different non-Hague Convention country. \n3. Change in marital status. \nIf your marital status changes before you complete the intercountry adoption process, you must submit a new \nForm I-600A or Form I-600 combination filing with an updated home study. You may not use Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3. \n4. Change of residence, including a change in the child’s proposed residence. If you move to a new state in the United States, you must meet any pre-adoption requirements of that new state if a child is coming to the United States for adoption. \n5. Significant decrease in availability of financial resources, such as loss of employment, garnishment of wages, etc. \n6. Any change in history of arrest or criminal history of any household member regardless of age. \n7. Any change in history of child abuse or neglect, substance abuse, family violence, and/or sexual abuse as an offender, for any household member regardless of age. \n8. Change in the number of and/or identity of children in your household, whether through adoption, foster care, birth, or any other means. \n9. Change in the number of and/or identity of adult members of your household. A Form I-600A/Form I-600, \nSupplement 1 is required for any new adult member of the household. \n10. Lapse of more than six months between the date your home study is completed and the date you submit it to USCIS. \n11. Change in the number of children or characteristics (such as age, sex, and/or special needs) of the child or children you intend to adopt. \n12. A development of a serious health condition for any household member, including but not limited to: heart attacks, cancer, strokes, conditions requiring extensive therapy, dementia, severe injuries, etc. \nYour adoption service provider can advise you on other changes that may require an updated home study. \nHow to File Updates to Your Home Study \nThe location for filing an update to your home study and the items you must include will depend on where you are in the \nadoption process. \nYou must submit a Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3 with your updated home study unless your Form I-600A or Form \nI-600 combination filing is pending. If your Form I-600A or Form I-600 combination filing is pending, submit your updated home study to the office reviewing your case; no Form I-600A/I-600 Supplement 3 is required. \nUSCIS will review your updated home study to determine your suitability and eligibility. \nDuty of Disclosure \nUnder 8 CFR 204.311(d), you, your spouse (if married), and any adult member of your household have an ongoing duty \nof disclosure throughout the intercountry adoption process. This duty requires you, your spouse, and any adult member of your household to: \n1. Provide true and complete information to your home study preparer; \n2. Disclose other relevant information, such as physical, mental, or emotional health problems or behavioral issues;\n\nForm I-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 12 of 14 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n 3. Disclose any arrest, conviction, or other criminal history, whether in the United States or abroad, even if the record \nof the arrest, conviction, or other criminal history was expunged, sealed, pardoned, or the subject of any other amelioration; \n4. Disclose any history of substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse or neglect, and/or family violence as an offender under 8 CFR 204.309(a)(1), even if closed or unsubstantiated; and \n5. Notify your home study preparer and USCIS of any new event or information that might require you to submit an updated home study. \nWith respect to child abuse or neglect, this duty of disclosure requires you to disclose any past or pending investigation by any child welfare agency, court, or other official authority in any state or foreign country concerning the abuse or neglect of any child even if closed or unsubstantiated. \nThis duty of disclosure is an ongoing duty that continues throughout the intercountry adoption process. This timeframe \nincludes periods while any Form I-600A is pending, after any Form I-600A is approved, while any Form I-600 is pending, \nand until there is a final decision admitting the child to the United States with a visa. \nWARNING \nUnder 8 CFR 204.309(a), USCIS will deny this petition if you, your spouse (if married), or any adult member of your \nhousehold: \n1. Conceal, misrepresent, or fail to disclose any facts to the home study preparer or USCIS about any arrest, conviction, \nor history of substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, and/or family violence, or any other criminal history as an offender. The fact that an arrest or conviction or other criminal history was expunged, sealed, pardoned, or the subject of any other amelioration does not relieve you, your spouse, or any additional adult member of your household of the obligation to disclose it; \n2. Fail to cooperate in having available child abuse registries checked in accordance with 8 CFR 204.31 1; or \n3. Fail to disclose, as required by 8 CFR 204.311, each and every prior adoption home study, whether completed or not, including those that did not favorably recommend you, your spouse, or any adult member of your household for \nadoption or custodial care. \nWhere To File? \nPlease see our website at www.uscis.gov/i-600 for the most current information about where to file this petition. \nAddress Change \nIf your address changes, you must notify the USCIS office with jurisdiction over your case. If you filed your petition \nwith the USCIS Lockbox, the National Benefits Center (NBC) has jurisdiction over your case. If you filed at a USCIS international office, that office has jurisdiction over your case. Due to your change in residence, USCIS may also require you to submit an updated home study for a significant change. If you move to a different state, you may also have to provide updated information regarding any pre-adoption requirements. \nSee the adoption-related pages on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption for information on significant changes \ndue to a change in residence and current mailing addresses for the NBC and USCIS international offices.

This means that an officer will review the H-4 or L-2 derivative’s Form I-539 after reviewing the principal’s Form I-129 and will take appropriate adjudicative action (that is, issue an approval, denial, RFE, NOID or refer for an investigation) after that adjudicative review.

Sex.  Indicate whether you are male or female as provided on your birth certificate issued at the time of \nbirth or issued closest to the time of birth or in secondary evidence you provided to USCIS, if applicable. \nCertification Pertaining to the Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons in the United \nStates\nU.S. Export Controls on Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons.  The Export \nAdministration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 770-774) and the International Traffic in \n Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 \nCFR Parts 120-130) require U.S. persons to seek and receive authorization from the U.S. Government before releasing to foreign persons in the United States controlled technology or technical data.  Under both the EAR and the IT AR, release \nof controlled technology or technical data to foreign persons in the United States--even by an employer --is deemed to be \nan export to that person’s country or countries of nationality.  One implication of this rule is that a U.S. company must seek and receive a license from the U.S. Government before it releases controlled technology or technical data to its nonimmigrant workers employed as H-1B, H-1B1, L-1, or O-1A beneficiaries.\nRequirement to Certify Compliance with U.S. Export Control Regulations.  The U.S. Government requires each \ncompany or other entity that files a Form I-129 to certify that to the best of its knowledge at the time of filing it has reviewed the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and determined whether it will require a U.S. Government export license to release controlled technology or technical data to the beneficiary.\nIf an export license is required, the company or other entity must further certify that it will not release or otherwise \nprovide access to controlled technology or technical data to the beneficiary until it has received the required authorization from the U.S. Government.\nThe petitioner must indicate whether or not a license is required in Part 6., Certification Regarding the Release of \nControlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons in the United States, of Form I-129.Controlled Technology and Technical Data.  The licensing requirements described above will affect only a small \npercentage of petitioners because most types of technology are not controlled for export or release to foreign persons.  The technology and technical data that are, however, controlled for release to foreign persons are identified on the EAR’s Commerce Control List (CCL) and the ITAR’s U.S. Munitions List (USML).  The CCL is found at 15 CFR Part 774, Supp. 1.  See http://www.access.gpo.gov/bis/ear/ear_data.html#ccl .  The USML is at 22 CFR 121.1.   \nSee http://www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations_laws/itar.html.  The EAR-controlled technology on the CCL generally pertains to that which is for the production, development, or use of what are generally known as “dual-use” items. The \nITAR-controlled technical data on the USML generally pertains to that which is directly related to defense articles. \nThe U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security administers the CCL and is responsible for \nissuing licenses for the release to foreign persons of technology controlled under the EAR.  The U.S. Department of \nState’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) administers the USML and is responsible for issuing licenses for the release to foreign persons of technical data controlled under the IT AR.  Information about the EAR and how to \napply for a license from BIS are at www.bis.doc.gov.  Specific information about EAR’s requirements pertaining to the \nrelease of controlled technology to foreign persons is at www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/deemed-exports.  \nInformation about the ITAR and how to apply for a license from DDTC are at www.pmddtc.state.gov.\nClassification - Initial Evidence\nFor all classifications, if a beneficiary is seeking a change of status, extension of stay, or amendment of stay, evidence \nof maintenance of status must be included with the new petition.

An E-2 CNMI investor classification is specifically limited to an alien investor who has previously been granted a qualifying long term investor status under the laws of the CNMI.  This classification allows an eligible alien to be lawfully present in the CNMI in order to maintain the investment during the transition period from CNMI to Federal immigration law.  An investor’s nationality is not a qualifying factor in the issuance of an E-2 CNMI investor classification.\nThis classification expires on December 31, 2029\nA petition for the initial issuance of an E-2 CNMI investor classification must be filed within 2 years of the date the E-2 \nCNMI investor classification became available, which was January 18, 201 1.  Petitions for the initial issuance of the E-2 \nCNMI filed after January 18, 2013 will be rejected.\nRequests for extension of the E-2 CNMI investor classification may be granted, in increments of not more than 2 years, \nuntil December 31, 2029.\nApplications for the dependents of E-2 CNMI investors must be filed on Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change \nNonimmigrant Status.\nWrite E-2C in the classification block.\nThe petition must be filed with documentary evidence of:\n1.

The fact that the beneficiary will not leave during the pendency of the extension of stay request.\nH-1B Nonimmigrants (Three Types)\nThe H-1B classification is for alien coming to the United States temporarily to perform services in a specialty \noccupation.\nWrite H-1B in the classification block.\nA specialty occupation is one that requires the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized \nknowledge to fully perform the occupation and requires the attainment of a bachelor ’ s or higher degree in a directly \nrelated specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States. A position  \nis not a specialty occupation if attainment of a general degree, without further specialization, is sufficient to qualify for the \nposition. A position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, provided that each of those fields is directly  \nrelated to the duties of the position. “Directly related” means that there is a logical connection between the degree, or its equivalent, and the duties of the position.  \nThe petition must be filed by a U.S. employer or a U.S. agent and must be filed with:\n1. Evidence that a labor condition application (LCA) has been certified by the U.S. Department of Labor;\n2. Evidence showing that the proposed employment qualifies as a specialty occupation;\n3. Evidence that you have a bona fide position in a specialty occupation available for the beneficiary as of the start \ndate of the validity period requested on the petition. A petitioner is not required to establish specific day-to-day assignments for the entire time period requested in the petition.\n4. Evidence showing that the beneficiary has the required degree by submitting either:\nA. A copy of the beneficiary’s U.S. bachelor’s or higher degree as required by the specialty occupation;\nB.

A copy of any written contract between the petitioner and the beneficiary or a summary of the terms of the oral \nagreement under which the beneficiary will be employed.\n7. If you are filing an H-1B cap petition for a fiscal year that H-1B registration is required, you must provide a valid Beneficiary Confirmation Number for the beneficiary included in this petition, along with a copy of the H-1B Registration Selection Notice. \n8. If you are filing an H-1B cap petition for a fiscal year that H-1B registration is required, you must submit evidence of \nthe beneficiary’s passport or travel document used at the time of registration to identify the beneficiary.\n9. Off-site Assignment of H-1B Beneficiaries:   Petitioners seeking to place the H-1B beneficiary off-site at a location   \nother than their own location must answer general questions regarding this assignment in Part 5., Basic Information \nAbout the Proposed Employment and Employer.  Petitioners should advise the H-1B beneficiary of the off-site work placement.\nThe H-1B classification is also for aliens coming to the United States to perform services of an exceptional nature \nrelating to a cooperative research and development project administered by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD).\nWrite H-1B2 in the classification requested block.\nA U.S. employer or U.S. agent may file the petition.\nThe petition must be filed with:\n1. A description of the proposed employment;\n2. Evidence that the services and project meet the above conditions;\n3. A statement listing the names of aliens who are currently or have been employed on the project within the past year, \nalong with their dates of employment;\n4. Evidence that the beneficiary holds a bachelor’s or higher degree or its equivalent in the field of employment; and\n5. A verification letter from the DOD project manager.  Details about the specific project are not required.\nThe H-1B classification is also for aliens of distinguished merit and ability in the field of fashion modeling.\nWrite H-1B3 in the classification block.\nThe petition must be filed by a U.S. employer or U.S. agent.  The petitioner must submit evidence that establishes the \nbeneficiary will perform services at events or productions of a distinguished reputation.  Such evidence includes:\n1. Documentary evidence (such as certifications, affidavits, and reviews) to establish the beneficiary is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability.  Any affidavits submitted by present or former employers or recognized experts must set forth their expertise of the affiant and the manner in which the affiant acquired such information; and\n2. Copies of any written contracts between the petitioner and the beneficiary or , if there is no written agreement, a \nsummary of the terms of the oral agreement under which the beneficiary will be employed.\nGeneral H-1B Requirements\nCompleting the H Classification Supplement FormItem Number 8.a. For H-1B petitions, you must indicate whether the beneficiary has a controlling interest in the \npetitioning organization.  For purposes of this question, a controlling interest means that the beneficiary owns more than 50 percent of the petitioning organization or when the beneficiary has majority voting rights in the petitioning organization. \nIf the H-1B beneficiary possesses a controlling interest in the petitioning or ganization or entity\n , the petition, if approved, \nwill be limited to a validity period of up to 18 months.  The first extension (including an amended petition with a request \nfor an extension of stay) of such a petition will also be limited to a validity period of up to 18 months.\nThree relevant laws impact the filing of H-1B and/or L visa petitions:\n1. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA),  Public Law 105-277 (signed into \nlaw on October 21, 1998);\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n 02/25/2025\nForm I-129 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 10 of 31\n2. The H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004 (signed into law on December 8, 2004); and\n3. Public Law 114-113 (signed into law on December 18, 2005).\nBecause of ACWIA, H-1B and H-1B1 free trade nonimmigrant petitioners must complete the H-1B Data Collection and \nFiling Fee Exemption Supplement, which is part of this petition.  W e use this supplement (formerly issued separately as \nForm I-129W) to collect additional information about the H-1B nonimmigrant workers and the H-1B petitioners, and to determine the applicability of fees mandated by ACWIA (INA section 214(c)(9)), the H-1B1 Visa Reform Act of 2004 (INA section 214(c)(12)), and Public Law 114-113.\nA petitioner seeking initial approval of H-1B or L nonimmigrant status for a beneficiary, or seeking approval to employ \nan H-1B or L nonimmigrant currently working for another employer, must submit an additional Fraud Prevention and Detection fee.  This fee does not apply to H-1B1 petitions.\nThose petitioners required to submit the Fraud Prevention and Detection fee are also required to submit either an \nadditional H-1B or L-1 fee mandated by Public Law 114-113, if:\n1. The petitioner employs 50 or more individuals in the United States; and\n2. More than 50 percent of those employees are in H-1B or L-1A or L-1B nonimmigrant status.\nTo determine if they are subject to any of these fees, petitioners must complete the H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement discussed below.  See Form G-1055 for specific fee amounts.\nH-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement\nA U.S. employer or U.S. agent who seek to place a beneficiary in H-1B classification (including H-1B1 classification for \nfree trade aliens from Chile and Singapore) must file this supplement.\nThe supplement is used to:\n1. Collect additional information about the H-1B employer and beneficiary; and\n2. Determine the appropriate American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) fee.  The ACWIA \nFee is a training fee meant to fund the training of U.S. workers.  But if the employer has 25 or fewer full-time employees, they must pay only one-half of the required fee at INA  214(c)(9)(B).  \n This supplement also helps to \ndetermine whether the beneficiary is subject to the H-1B numerical limitation (also known as the H-1B Cap).  Please note that the ACWIA fee may not be assessed to the beneficiary.\nWho is required to submit this supplement?\nA U.S. employer or U.S. agent seeking to classify a beneficiary as an H-1B or H-1B1 Free Trade Nonimmigrant worker \nmust file this supplement with the Form I-129 and the appropriate fee.\nCompleting Section 1. of the H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplement Form\nAll petitioners who seek to classify a beneficiary as an H-1B or H-1B1 free trade nonimmigrant worker must answer every \nquestion in Item Number 1. of Section 1., General Information .  Guidance on how to answer these questions follows.\n1. H-1B dependent employer.  An “H-1B dependent employer” is an employer that:\nA. Has 25 or fewer full-time-equivalent employees who are employed in the United States and employs more than seven H-1B nonimmigrants;\nB. Has at least 26 but not more than 50 full-time-equivalent employees who are employed in the United States and employs more than 12 H-1B nonimmigrants; or\nC. Has at least 51 full-time equivalent employees who are employed in the United States and employs H-1B nonimmigrants in a number that is equal to at least 15 percent of the number of such full-time-equivalent employees.\n2. Willful violators.   A willful violator is an employer whom the U.S. Secretary of Labor has found, after notice and \nopportunity for a hearing, to have willfully failed to meet a condition of the labor condition application described in \nsection 212(n) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n 02/25/2025\nForm I-129 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 11 of 31\n3. Exempt H-1B nonimmigrant.  An “exempt H-1B nonimmigrant” is an H-1B nonimmigrant who:\nA. Receives wages (including cash bonuses and similar compensation) at an annual rate equal to at least $60,000; or\nB. Has attained a master’s degree or higher (or its equivalent) in a specialty related to the intended employment.\n4. Highest level of formal education.   In Item Number 2. of Section 1., place an “X” in the appropriate box that most \nclosely reflects the highest level of formal education the beneficiary has attained.\n5. Major/primary field of study.  Use the beneficiary’s degree transcripts to determine the primary field of study.  DO \nNOT consider work experience to determine the beneficiary’s major field of study.\n6. Master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education.  Indicate whether or not the beneficiary has earned a master’s or higher degree from a U.S. institution of higher education, as defined in 20 U.S.C. section 1001(a).\n7. Rate of pay per year.  The “rate of pay’’ is the salary or wages paid to the beneficiary.  Salary or wages must be expressed in an annual full-time amount and do not include non-cash compensation or benefits.  For example, an H-1B worker is to be paid $6,500 per month for a 4-month period and also provided separately a health benefits package and transportation during the 4-month period.  The yearly rate of pay if he or she were working for a full year would be 12 times the monthly rate, or $78,000.  This amount does not include health benefits or transportation costs. The figure $78,000 should be entered on this form as the rate of pay .\n8. SOC Code.  This is the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) Code.  You can obtain the SOC codes from the Department of Labor (DOL), Bureau of Labor Statistics at www.bls.gov/soc.\n9. NAICS Code.   This is the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code.  This code can be obtained \nfrom the U.S. Department of Commerce, Census Bureau ( www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html).  Enter the code \nfrom left to right, one digit in each of the six boxes.  If you use a code with fewer than six digits, enter the code left to right and then add zeros in the remaining unoccupied boxes.\nFor example, the code sequence 33466 would be entered as:  \n [Each number inside a separate \nbox]For example, the code sequence 5133 would be entered as:  \n [Each number inside a separate \nbox]\nCompleting Section 2. of the H-1B and H-1B1 Data Collection and Filing Fee Exemption Supplemental FormPetitioners must complete Section 2., Fee Exemption and/or Determination, to determine whether they must pay the \nACWIA fee.

This does not apply to amended petitions which request to substitute H-2B workers using the same temporary labor certificate.\nAdditional Information Regarding H-2A and H-2B Petitions\nProhibited H-2A and H-2B Fees\nAs a condition of approval of an H-2A or H-2B petition, no job placement fee, fee or penalty for breach of contract, or \nother fee, penalty, or compensation (either direct or indirect) related to the H-2A or H-2B employment (collectively, \n“prohibited fees”) may be collected at any time from a beneficiary of an H-2A  or H-2B petition or any person acting \non the beneficiary’s behalf by a petitioner, a petitioner’s employee, agent, attorney, facilitator, recruiter, or similar \nemployment service, or any employer (if different from the petitioner).  The term “similar employment service” refers \nto any person or entity that recruits or solicits prospective beneficiaries of the H-2 petition.  This includes recruitment \nor employment services offered by private, nongovernmental individuals and entities, as well as quasi-governmental \nentities and governmental entities, whether or not such person or entity is located in the United States.  Further , in the \nH-2A context, no such fee related to the H-2A employment may be collected by a petitioner’s joint employers, including a \npetitioner’s member employers if the petitioner is an association of United States agricultural producers, whether before or \nafter the filing or approval of a petition.  Prohibited fees may include, but are not limited to, deduction or withholding of \nwages or salary, whether or not such deduction or withholding of wages or salary provides some benefit to the beneficiary.  \nThe passing of a cost to the beneficiary that, by statute or applicable regulations is the responsibility of the petitioner , \nconstitutes the collection of a prohibited fee .\nIt is not prohibited for workers to provide reimbursement for costs paid on their behalf that are the responsibility and \nprimarily for the benefit of the worker, such as government-required passport fees.  Furthermore, it is not prohibited for \nemployers to reimburse a worker for fees or expenses incurred by the worker where such reimbursement is specifically \npermitted by, and made in compliance with, all applicable federal, state and/or local statute or regulations .\nThe petition should be filed with evidence that indicates the beneficiaries have not paid, and will not pay , prohibited fees.\nThe petition will be denied or revoked if USCIS determines that the petitioner or any petitioner ’\n s employee, agent, \nattorney, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service, or any employer or joint employer, collected, or entered into an agreement to collect, prohibited fees, as described above, whether before or after the filing of the petition .\nThe only exceptions to a mandatory denial or revocation for prohibited fees are as follows.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n 02/25/2025\nForm I-129 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 15 of 31\nIf the petitioner or any of its employees collected or entered into an agreement to collect a prohibited fee, a petitioner must \ndemonstrate through clear and convincing evidence that:\n1. The petitioner made ongoing, good faith reasonable efforts to prevent and learn of the prohibited fee(s) collection or \nagreement by such parties throughout the recruitment, hiring, and employment process;\n2. Extraordinary circumstances beyond the petitioner’s control resulted in the petitioner’s failure to prevent collection or entry into agreement for collection of prohibited fees; \n3. The petitioner took immediate remedial action as soon as the petitioner became aware of the payment or agreement to pay prohibited fees, including ensuring the termination of any agreement to collect such fees; and \n4. The petitioner fully reimbursed all affected beneficiaries or the beneficiaries’  designees if applicable (see note below).\nIf any employer, agent, attorney, facilitator, recruiter, or similar employment service collected or entered into an \nagreement to collect a prohibited fee, a petitioner must demonstrate through clear and convincing evidence that:\n1. The petitioner made ongoing, good faith reasonable efforts to prevent and learn of the prohibited fee(s) collection or \nagreement by such parties throughout the recruitment, hiring, and employment process.  (A  written contract between \nthe petitioner and any agent, attorney, facilitator, recruiter, similar employment service, or member employer stating that such fees were prohibited will not, by itself, be sufficient to meet this standard of proof.); \n2. The petitioner took immediate remedial action as soon as it became aware of the payment of the prohibited fee or \nagreement; and\n3. All affected beneficiaries or the beneficiaries’ designees, if applicable, have been fully reimbursed (see note below).\nNOTE:  A beneficiary’s designee may be reimbursed only if an affected beneficiary cannot be located or is deceased.  \nA designee must be an individual or entity for whom the beneficiary has provided prior written authorization to receive such reimbursement, as long as the petitioner or its agent, employer , attorney\n , facilitator, recruiter, or similar \nemployment service would not act as such designee or derive any financial benefit, either directly or indirectly , from the \nreimbursement.\nIf the petition was denied or revoked for prohibited fees, or if the petitioner withdrew the petition after USCIS issued a \nnotice of intent to deny or revoke on this basis, any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files within 1 year after the decision or acknowledgment of withdrawal will be denied.  After such 1-year \nperiod, any H-2A or H-2B petition that the petitioner or the petitioner’s successor in interest files will be denied for an additional 3 years unless each affected beneficiary, or the beneficiary’s designee as appropriate, has been reimbursed in full.  Denial on this basis will apply to petitions for both the H-2A  and H-2B classifications regardless of whether the \ndenial, revocation, or withdrawal occurred in the H-2A or H-2B program.  \nOther Violations\nUSCIS has the authority to deny H-2A or H-2B petitions if the petitioner has been found to have committed certain \nserious labor law violations or otherwise violated the requirements of the H-2A  or H-2B program.  Prospective denials \nunder this provision will apply across both H-2 classifications regardless of whether the violation occurred in the H-2A  \nor H-2B program.  For the purposes of this denial authority, a criminal conviction or final administrative or judicial \ndetermination against any one of the following individuals will be treated as a conviction or final administrative or judicial \ndetermination against the petitioner or successor in interest:\n1. An individual acting on behalf of the petitioner, which could include, among others, the petitioner’s owner, employee, \nor contractor; or \n2. For the purposes of discretionary denial, any employee of the petitioner who a reasonable person in the H-2A  or H-2B \nworker’s position would believe is acting on behalf of the petitioner. \nThe term “successor in interest” means an employer that is controlling and carrying on the business of a previous \nemployer regardless of whether such successor in interest has succeeded to all of the rights and liabilities of the predecessor entity.  USCIS looks at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(xi)(C) and (6)(i)(D) to determine whether an employer is a successor in interest.  \nWhether the denial is mandatory or discretionary will depend on the nature of the past violation(s), as described below .\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n 02/25/2025\nForm I-129 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 16 of 31\nMandatory Denial\nUSCIS is required by regulation to deny any H-2A or H-2B petition filed on or after January 17, 2025 by a petitioner (or \nits successor in interest) that has been the subject of one or more of the following actions:\n1. A final administrative determination by the Secretary of Labor debarring the petitioner from filing or receiving a \nfuture labor certification under 20 CFR part 655 subpart A or B, 29 CFR parts 501 or 503, or a final administrative \ndetermination by the Governor of Guam debarring the petitioner from issuance of future labor certifications under \napplicable Guam regulations and rules, if the petition is filed during the debarment period, or if the debarment occurs \nduring the pendency of the petition, and the final administrative determination debarring the petitioner is made on or \nafter January 17, 2025;\n2. A final USCIS denial or revocation decision made on a prior H-2A or H-2B petition filed on or after January 17, 2025 \nthat includes a finding of fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact during the pendency of the petition or \nwithin 3 years prior to filing the petition; or\n3. A final determination of violation(s) under section 274(a) of the Act made on or after January 17, 2025, and during the pendency of the petition or within 3 years prior to filing the petition. \nDiscretionary Denial\nUSCIS may deny any H-2A or H-2B petition filed by a petitioner (or its successor in interest) on or after January 17, 2025, \nthat has been the subject of one or more of the following actions during the pendency of the petition (except as provided in Item 1.B. below), or within 3 years prior to filing the petition, if USCIS determines that the underlying violation(s) calls into question the petitioner’s or successor’s intention and/or ability to comply with H-2A or H-2B program requirements.\n1. A final administrative determination by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor or Governor of Guam with \nrespect to a prior H-2A or H-2B temporary labor certification that includes:\nA. Revocation of an approved temporary labor certification under 20 CFR 655 Subpart A or B, or applicable Guam \nregulations and rules; \nB. Debarment under 20 CFR 655 subpart A or B, 29 CFR parts 501 or 503, or applicable Guam regulations and rules, \nif the debarment period has concluded prior to filing the petition; or\nC. Any other administrative sanction or remedy under 29 CFR part 501 or 503, or applicable Guam regulations and rules, including assessment of civil money penalties as described in those parts. \n2. A final USCIS decision revoking the approval of a prior petition that includes one or more of the following \nfindings:  the beneficiary was not employed by the petitioner in the capacity specified in the petition; the statement \nof facts contained in the petition or on the application for a temporary labor certification was not true and correct, \nor was inaccurate; the petitioner violated terms and conditions of the approved petition; or the petitioner violated \nrequirements of section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Act or paragraph (h) of this section.\n3. Any Federal, state, or local final administrative or judicial determination (other than one described in                           8 CFR 214.2(h)(10)(iv)(A)) that the petitioner violated any applicable employment-related laws or regulations, \nincluding health and safety laws or regulations. \nIf the petitioner has been the subject of one of the above determinations, the petitioner must demonstrate to USCIS that \nthe underlying violation(s) does not call into question its intent and ability to comply with H-2 program requirements.  In determining whether the violation(s) underlying the above determinations call into question the petitioner ’\n s (or \nsuccessor’s) intent and ability to comply with H-2 program requirements, USCIS will consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to:\n1. The recency and number of violation(s);\n2. The egregiousness of the violation(s), including how many workers were affected, and whether it involved a risk to \nthe health or safety of workers;\n3. Overall history or pattern of prior violation(s);\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n 02/25/2025\nForm I-129 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 17 of 31\n4. The severity or monetary amount of any penalties imposed;\n5. Whether the final determination, decision, or conviction included a finding of willfulness;\n6. The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation(s), or the potential financial loss or \npotential financial injury to the workers; \n7. Timely compliance with all penalties and remedies ordered under the final determination(s), decision(s), or \nconviction(s); and\n8. Other corrective actions taken by the petitioner or its successor in interest to cure its violation(s) or prevent future \nviolations.\nNOTE:  You should submit any evidence that relates to the above factors or that is otherwise relevant to your \npast violations and/or your intent and ability to comply with program requirements going forward.  If USCIS has previously determined that a petitioner (or the preceding entity , if the petitioner is a successor in interest) has established \nits intention and the ability to comply with H-2A or H-2B program requirements based on the same violation(s), USCIS will not seek to deny a petition under paragraph (h)(10)(iv)(B), unless there is evidence of a new material fact or if USCIS determines that its previous determination was based on a material error of law .\nNotification Requirements\nBy filing an H-2A or H-2B petition, the petitioner agrees to notify USCIS within 2 work days if an H-2A or H-2B worker:\n1. Does not report to work within 5 workdays after the employment start date stated on the petition or within 5 workdays \nafter the start date as established by the H-2A employer, whichever is later;\n2. Completes the labor or services more than 30 days earlier than the employment end date stated on the petition;\n3. Does not report for work for a period of 5 consecutive workdays without the consent of the employer; or\n4. Is terminated prior to the completion of the services or labor.\nThe above notification requirement is an employer obligation and does not establish wrongdoing on the part of the worker .  \nFurther, USCIS does not consider the information provided in an employer notification, alone, to be conclusive evidence regarding the worker’s current status.\nFailure to comply with this agreement may result in penalties against the petitioner .  See www.uscis.gov/h-2a and     \nwww.uscis.gov/h-2b, respectively, for more information, including the appropriate manner of notifying DHS.\nFiling Multiple Petitions\nYou generally may file one petition to request all of your H-2A or H-2B workers associated with one temporary labor \ncertification (with a limit of 25 named workers per petition).  In cases where filing a separate petition is not required, \nit may nevertheless be advantageous to file more than one H-2A or H-2B petition instead.  This can occur when you \npetition for multiple workers, some of whom may not qualify for part or all of the validity period you request.  This most \nfrequently occurs when :\n1. You request workers who have an uninterrupted period of absence of at least 60 days from the United States ; or\n2. At least one worker is nearing the 3-year maximum stay limit.\nIf we request additional evidence because of these situations, it may delay petition processing.  Filing separate petitions \nfor workers who are not affected by these scenarios may enable you to quickly obtain some workers, if they are otherwise eligible, in the event that the petition for your other workers is delayed.\nIf you decide to file more than one petition with the same temporary labor certification, you may do so if:\n1. The total number of beneficiaries on your petitions does not exceed the total number of workers approved by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor on the temporary labor certification; and\n2. Each petition is accompanied by a copy of the same temporary labor certification.\nPeriod of Absence\nAn absence from the United States for an uninterrupted period of at least 60 days will provide a new total of 3 years of \nH-2A or H-2B status that may be granted.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n 02/25/2025\nForm I-129 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 18 of 31\nThe 3-year maximum period of stay in H-2A or H-2B status does not automatically restart if the worker departs the United \nStates.  It restarts only if the absence is for a continuous period of at least 60 days. \nRecruitment of H-2A and H-2B Workers\nThe petitioner must provide the name(s) and address(es) of all agents, facilitators, recruiters, or similar employment \nservices hired by or working for the petitioner to locate and/or recruit the H-2A  or H-2B workers that the petitioner \nintends to hire by filing this petition.  The petitioner must provide this information regardless of whether the petitioner has a direct or indirect contractual relationship, and whether such person or entity is located inside or outside the United States or is a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.  \nNOTE:  U.S. Department of Labor regulations require H-2A petitioners to continue to keep foreign labor recruiter \ninformation up to date until the end of the work contract period, with this updated information available in the event of a \npost-certification audit or upon request by the Department of Labor . \n Additionally, the Department of State may request up \nto date foreign labor recruiter information at the time of visa application.\nH-3 Nonimmigrants (Two Types)\nThe H-3 classification is for aliens coming to the United States temporarily to participate in a special education \nexchange visitor program in the education of children with physical, mental, or emotional disabilities.\nWrite H-3 in the classification block.\nIncluding more than one beneficiary in a petition.

However, in certain situations, a petitioner may request that the beneficiary be granted initial status in the CNMI.  This will allow certain beneficiaries who were present in the CNMI prior to the  transition date and are currently lawfully present in the CNMI with a valid unexpired CNMI status to be granted an initial status without having to depart the CNMI.  Additionally, an alien who is currently in parole status in the CNMI may also be granted an initial status in the CNMI.\nThe E-2 CNMI investor regulations permit a petitioner to request that the alien be granted an initial E-2 CNMI investor \nstatus in the CNMI.  In addition to the classification requirements, the petitioner must submit documentation that the beneficiary is currently lawfully present in the CNMI.\nThe regulations indicate that if the beneficiary is lawfully present in the CNMI the beneficiary may apply for a change \nof status with this form without having to seek consular processing.  In addition to the classification requirements, the petitioner must submit documentation that the beneficiary is currently lawfully present in the CNMI.\nA petition for a grant of initial status for a beneficiary currently in the CNMI with a CNMI issued permit must have been \nfiled on or before November 27, 2011.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n 02/25/2025\nForm I-129 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 29 of 31\nWritten Consultation for O and P Nonimmigrants\nWritten consultation.  Certain classifications require a written consultation with a recognized peer group, labor , and/ or \nmanagement organization regarding the nature of the work to be done and the beneficiary’s qualifications before USCIS \ncan approve the petition.\nTo obtain timely adjudication of a petition, you should obtain a written advisory opinion from an appropriate peer group, \nlabor, and/or management organization and submit it with the petition.\nIf you file a petition without the advisory opinion, you will need to send a copy of the petition and all supporting \ndocuments to the appropriate organization when you file the petition with USCIS, and name that organization in the petition.  Explain to the organization that USCIS will contact them for an advisory opinion.\nIf you do not know the name of an appropriate organization with which to consult, indicate that on the petition.  However, \na petition filed without the actual advisory opinion will require substantially longer processing time.\nLiability for Return Transportation\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act makes a petitioner liable for the reasonable cost of return transportation for an H-1B, H-2B, O, and P beneficiary who is dismissed before the end of the period of authorized admission.\nWhen To File?\nGenerally, a Form I-129 petition may not be filed more than 6 months prior to the date employment is scheduled to begin.

The period varies for different nonimmigrant categories. We understand that plans can change. If your original reason for coming to the United States changes, you may be eligible to extend your status or you may be required to change your nonimmigrant status to a different one before you lawfully begin to engage in the activities you want to pursue.\nYou may apply to extend or change your status in the United States if you:\nWere lawfully admitted into the United States as a nonimmigrant;\nHave not committed any act that would make you ineligible to receive an immigration benefit;\nThere is no other factor that requires you to depart the United States prior to making a reentry based on a different classification (for example, a USCIS officer may determine that you should obtain a new visa prior to being readmitted into the United States); and\nSubmit your Form I-539 application for an extension or change of status by mail or you can file online\nbefore\nthe expiration date as shown on the admission stamp in your travel document on your Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record. (There are certain very limited circumstances under which USCIS will excuse a late submission.)\nPlease note that some nonimmigrant visa categories are not eligible to extend or change status (C, D, K-1, K-2, S, TWOV, WT, and WB) and some can only change or extend status subject to certain restrictions (J-1 and M-1). For further guidance, please refer to the filing instructions for Form I-539.\nIf you are eligible to file an I-539 application, you must apply for extension of stay or change of status before your current authorized stay expires. Even if you are approved for another status in the future, you will be required to file a Form I-539 to “bridge” any gap that might arise between the expiration of your current status and validity of your future status. Therefore, we suggest you file at least 45 days before your stay expires or as soon as you determine your need to change or extend status. Failure to file before the expiration date may be excused if you demonstrate when you file the application that:\nThe delay was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond your control;\nThe length of the delay was reasonable;\nYou have not otherwise violated your status;\nYou are still a bona fide nonimmigrant; and\nYou are not in removal proceedings.\nYour passport must be valid for your entire requested period of stay in the new nonimmigrant classification in the United States.\nIf your status expired before you filed Form I-539 with USCIS to change or extend your status, or if you have otherwise violated the terms of your status (such as by working without authorization), then you are “out of status.” If you fall out of status, we cannot change your status except in certain limited circumstances beyond your control. Staying longer than the period for which you were granted admission may also negatively affect your ability to obtain other benefits or to return to the United States later. If you fall out of status, we recommend that you leave the United States to limit the possible impact on your ability to come back to the United States in the future.\nFiling Fee\nYou can find the filing fee for Form I-539 by visiting our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nYou can pay the fee by\ncredit card\nor debit card using\nForm G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions\n, or by\nACH transaction\nusing\nForm G-1650, Authorization for ACH Transactions\n. We will also accept a money order, personal check, or cashier’s check. If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\nWhen you send a payment, you agree to pay for a government service. Filing fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request.\nIf you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our\nFee Calculator\nto help determine your fee.\nIf you are submitting multiple forms, pay each filing fee separately.

You must file your Form I-589 with EOIR if you are in proceedings before an immigration judge or before the Board of Immigration Appeals and you are not and were never determined to be a UAC.\nThese steps will help you determine whether you are in EOIR proceedings:\nHave you been issued an \"Alien Number\" (A-Number)? The A-Number begins with the letter “A” and is followed by 8 or 9 digits (for example, A123456789). This number is printed on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and EOIR correspondence and documents, including USCIS, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) documents.\nIf you have been issued an A-Number, check whether you are in EOIR proceedings by:\nCalling the EOIR Automated Case Information Hotline toll-free in the United States at 800-898-7180 (TDD 800-828-1120) or 304-625-2050 (local toll call); or\nChecking the\nEOIR Automated Case Information\nonline system.\nIf the EOIR hotline or online system has information regarding your name and next hearing date, then your Form I-862, Notice to Appear (NTA), has been filed and docketed with EOIR and you are in EOIR proceedings. If you want to apply for asylum, you must file your Form I-589 with EOIR. To locate where to file your Form I-589 with EOIR:\nUse the EOIR hotline or online system to locate an address for the immigration court where you must file your Form I-589; or\nFind immigration court information on the\nDepartment of Justice’s\nwebsite.\nIf you are currently in EOIR proceedings and you were asked to provide your biometric and biographical information to USCIS for your Form I-589 filed with EOIR, please refer to the\nInstructions for Submitting Certain Applications in Immigration Court and for Providing Biometric and Biographic Information to U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\nand the Defensive Asylum Security and Background Checks and Biometrics Scheduling FAQs section of the\nImmigration Benefits in EOIR Proceedings\npage about how to submit this information.\nImportant:\nIf you file your Form I-589 anywhere other than the immigration court identified by the EOIR hotline or online system, EOIR will reject your Form I-589 and send you a notice that specifies the address where you should file your Form I-589. If you do not follow these instructions and any additional instructions from DHS or EOIR, your Form I-589 may be rejected or closed or it may take longer to process your Form I-589.\nFor more information about applying for asylum while in EOIR proceedings, see the section on Defensive Asylum Processing with EOIR on the\nObtaining Asylum in the United States\nwebpage.\nFiling with USCIS\nIf you are eligible to apply for asylum with USCIS as outlined in the section above, you may file your Form I-589 with USCIS online or by mail depending on your situation. The mailing address to file your paper Form I-589 will depend on where you live and whether you are subject to the Special Instructions (see section below).\nTo determine whether you may file your Form I-589 with USCIS online or by mail, use our\nFiling Instructions Tool\n.\nNote:\nYou cannot file online and must file your Form I-589 by mail if:\nYou are currently, or were previously determined to be, an\nunaccompanied alien child (UAC)\nas defined in 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).

Fees are final and non-refundable, regardless of any action we take on your application, petition, or request, or if you withdraw your request.\nIf you pay by credit card or debit card, you cannot later dispute the payment. Use our\nFee Calculator\nto help determine your fee.\nIf you are submitting multiple forms, pay each fee separately. We are transitioning to electronically processing immigration benefit requests, which requires us to use multiple systems to process your package. We may reject your entire package if you submit a single, combined payment for multiple forms.\nNote:\nOn July 18, 2025, USCIS\nannounced\nnew fees required by the H.R. 1 Reconciliation Bill. For information about fees, please visit our\nFee Schedule\npage.\nAnnual Asylum Fee (AAF):\nPublic Law 119-21 (P. L. 119-21) requires all aliens with a pending Form I-589 to pay an Annual Asylum Fee (AAF) of $100 for each calendar year that their application is pending, in addition to any other fee. If you have a pending Form I-589 and you need to pay the new AAF, you should receive a notice from USCIS. We are also notifying representatives listed on Form G-28. The AAF is in addition to any other fee that may be due. You cannot get a waiver for the AAF.\nIf you receive a notice, you should pay this fee within 30 days. If you do not pay this fee, it may negatively affect your application, including, but not limited to, a delay in processing.\nYou must pay this fee online at\nhttps://my.uscis.gov/accounts/annual-asylum-fee/start/overview\n. You will need your Alien Registration Number (A-Number) and the Receipt Number at the top of your notice to pay the fee.\nWe will provide guidance later for future years’ AAF payments.\nForm Filing Tips\nSee our\nFiling Instructions Tool\nto determine whether to file your Form I-589 with USCIS online or by mail.\nGeneral Filing Tips for filing Form I-589 by mail:\nReview the instructions for eligibility requirements for yourself, spouse, and children.\nUse the correct edition of the form.

\n \n无论您的移民身份如何， 您都可以申请庇护，即使您在美国 非法居留，除非法规或条例另有规定。  \n \n您必须在您到达美国后一年内提交此申请， 除非您能证明存在实质性影响您的庇护资格的情况变\n化，或导致您无法在一年内提交申请的 特殊情况。 （参见本说明第一部分第五节 获得律师辩护权 ） \n \n无人陪伴的外籍 儿童（UAC ）是一个法律术语，指的是在美国没有合法移民身份；未满 18岁；在美\n国没有父母或法定监护人，或者在美国没有父母或法定监护人可以提供看护和监护的非美国公民儿童。参见 《美国法典》第 6卷第279(g)(2)节 。庇护部对 UAC提出的庇护申请有初步管辖权，包括\n移民法官 受理的驱逐程序中的 UAC。有关UAC庇护程序的更多信息，请访问美国移民局庇护网站：\nwww.uscis.gov/humanitarian/  refugees -asylum/asylum/minor -children -applying -asylum - themselves 。 \n 详细的UAC\n申请说明见本说明第一部分 第十二节 。 \n 如果您以前曾被移民法官或移民上诉委员会 拒绝庇护， 您必须证明 影响您的庇护资格 的情况已经改\n变。 \n \n在您完成 与庇护官员的 庇护面谈或 与移民法官的 听证后，将决定您是否被允许申请庇护。即使 您因\n上述原因没有资格申请庇护，您仍有资格根据《移民和国籍法》第 241(b)(3)节或根据《反对酷刑\n公约》向移民法院申请暂缓遣返。  \n \n根据《美国法典》第 48卷第1806(A)(7) 节，如果 您身在北马里亚纳群岛联邦，或 即将抵达北马里\n亚纳群岛联邦， 您可以在 2010年1月1日之前申请庇护；但是，您可以使用 I-589表《庇护和暂缓\n遣返申请》在移民法庭程序中根据《反对酷刑公约》申请暂缓遣返和免遣返 保护。 \n \n[第3页] \n \n第一部分  申请说明（续上页）  \n二、资格依据 \n \nA.庇护 \n \n为获得庇护资格，您必须证明 您是一个难民，由于种族、宗教、国籍、特定社会群体的成员身份或\n政治观点而遭受迫害或有充分理由担心遭受迫害，因此无法或不愿意返回国籍国或最后一个常住地\n址（如果您没有国籍） 。这意味着 您必须证明种族、宗教、国籍、特定社会群体成员身份或政治观\n点曾经或将成为 您遭受迫害的至少一个核心原因，或者您担心 遭受迫害的原因 。（参见《移民和国\n籍法》第 208节；《联邦法规》第 8卷第208和1208节等）。 \n \n如果您获得庇护， 您和您申请中包括的任何符合条件的配偶或子女可以留在美国工作，且最终 可能\n调整为合法的永久居民身份。 如果您没有获得庇护，国土安全部（ DHS）可能会使用 您在此申请中提\n供的信息 决定将您从美国驱逐出境。\n\nB.暂缓遣返  \n \n您的庇护申请也被认为是根据修订《移民和国籍法》第 241(b)(3) 节提出的暂缓遣返申请。 如果您\n勾选了表格 第一页顶部的方框，或者如果 您提出的证据表明 您可能会 在遣返国遭受酷刑， 则此表格\n也可以被视为根据《反 对酷刑公约》提出的暂缓 遣返申请。（参见《联邦法规 》第8卷第\n208.13(c)(1)和 1208.13(c)(1)节 ）。如果庇护不被批准， 您可能仍有暂缓遣返资格 。 \n 无论暂缓遣返的 申请依据 如何，但如果您曾有以下任意行为 ，您就没有 申请资格：  \n \n1.协助纳粹迫害行为 或从事种族灭绝活动 ； \n \n2.迫害他人； \n \n3.被最终判决判定犯有对美国社会构成威胁 的特别严重的罪行；  \n \n4.由于重大原因在美国境外犯下严重的非政治性罪行；或  \n \n5.对美国的安全构成威胁 。（参见 《移民和国籍法》第 241(b)(3) 节；《联邦法规》 第8卷第\n208.16和1208.16节）。 \n \n根据《移民和国籍法》第 241(b)(3) 节的暂缓遣返  \n 为获得《移民和国籍法》第 241(b)(3)节 规定的暂缓遣返资格，您 必须证明 您的生命或自由很可能\n会因为种族、宗教、国籍、特定社会群体 成员或政治观点而在拟议遣返国受到威胁。  \n 如果您获得了 暂缓遣返 令，您不会被遣返到您的生命或自由会受到威胁的国家。这意味着， 您可能\n会被遣返 到您的生命或自由 不会受到威胁的第三国 。暂缓遣返并不包括申请中的任何配偶或子女；\n他们必须 自行申请这种保护。 \n \n如果您被批准暂缓遣返，这将不能赋予您 将亲属带到美国的权利。 它也不会 赋予您在美国申请合法\n永久居民身份的权利。  \n \n根据《反对酷刑公约》 的暂缓遣返  \n \n《反对酷刑公约》是指 联合国《联合国 反对酷刑 和其他残忍、不人道或有辱人格的待遇或处罚公\n约》。 \n \n根据美国法律实施的《 反对酷刑公约》第 3节，如要获准暂缓遣返 到某个国家， 您必须证明 您在那\n个国家很有可能 遭受酷刑。  \n \n《联邦法规》第 8卷第208.18(a) 节和第1208.18(a)节对“酷刑” 进行了定义，其中纳入了美国法\n律中实施的《反对 酷刑公约》第 1节的定义 。要将某种 行为认定为是酷刑， 其必须是一种极端残忍\n和不人道的待遇，必须造成严重的身体或精神痛苦和折磨， 且必须以造成 严重痛苦和折磨为目的 。 \n 酷刑是指出于以下目的而实施的行为：获取 受害者或第三人 提供的信息或供词；因受害者或第三人\n\n所犯或涉嫌的行为而对其 作出处罚 ；恐吓或胁迫受害者或第三人；或基于任何歧视类原因。  \n \n酷刑必须是由公职人员或其他以官方身份行事的人实施或在其唆使、同意或默许下实施的。 受害者\n必须被施暴者 监禁或实际控制 。酷刑不包括仅由合法制裁引起的、合法制裁所固有或附带的 折磨或\n痛苦，尽管这类行动可能 符合《反对 酷刑公约》的目标和宗旨。  \n 如果您告诉移民法官， 您希望根据 《反对酷刑公约》 被考虑暂缓遣返，或者如果确定有证据表明您\n可能在遣返国遭受酷刑，那么 I-589表将被视为根据《反对 酷刑公约》提出的暂缓遣返申请。  \n \n[第4页] \n \n如要根据《 反对酷刑公约》申请暂缓遣返，您必须在申请书 第1页的顶部打勾，并完整填写 I-589\n表。 \n 您必须在对申请书\nB部分问题4的回答中详细解释 您担忧酷刑 的原因。在您的回答中，您必须写出\n您所经历的任何虐待或政府或与政府有关的人对 您进行的任何威胁。  \n 只有移民法官和移民上诉委员会可以根据《反对 酷刑公约》批准暂缓遣返或推迟遣返 。如果您已经\n申请庇护，移民法官将首先确定您 是否有资格获得《移民和国籍法》第 208节规定的庇护和《移民\n和国籍法》第 241(b)(3)节规定的暂缓遣返。如果您没有资格获得《移民和国籍法》第 208节规定\n的庇护或《移民和国籍法》第 241(b)(3) 节规定的暂缓遣返，移民法官将确定《反对 酷刑公约》是\n否禁止将 您遣返到 您担忧遭受 酷刑的国家。  \n 根据美国法律规定，《 反对酷刑公约》第 3\n节禁止美国将 您遣返到一个 您很可能会遭受酷刑的国\n家。《反对酷刑 公约》并不禁止美国将您 送回任何其他不会对您实施酷刑的国家 。这意味着您 可能\n会被遣送到一个 您不会遭受酷刑的第三国 。根据《反对酷刑公约》暂缓遣返不允许您 调整为合法的\n永久居民身份，也不允许 您申请将 家属带到美国，或留在美国。  \n \nC.根据《反对酷刑公约》 的推迟驱逐出境  \n \n如果您很可能 会在某个国家遭受酷刑，但 您没有资格获得暂缓遣返，根据 《联邦法规 》第8卷第\n208.17(a) 和1208.17(a) 节，您的遣返将被推迟 。推迟遣返 并不赋予您在美国的任何合法或永久移\n民身份，也不一定会导致 监禁解除 。推迟遣返将在终止后失效 。如果确定 您不再可能在推迟遣返国\n家遭受酷刑，或者您要求终止推迟遣返，那么推迟遣返被审查 并终止。 \n \nD.与资格有关的法律来源和指导意见  \n \n下面列出的文件是与根据《移民和国籍法》第 241(b)(3)节 规定的庇护、暂缓遣返以及根据《反对\n酷刑公约》规定的暂缓遣返或推迟遣返有关的一些法律资源 和指南。 \n \n这些资源 仅供参考 。您无需在填写申请时进行引用 。 \n \n1. 《移民和国籍法》第 101(a)(42)节 ，《美国法典》第 8卷第1101(a)(42)

）。仅\n仅因为是他人告诉或建议您在庇护申请中提供虚假信息不能使您的申请免于被认定为无意义申请。  \n \nE部分 表格填写人签名（如果表格由他人填写）  \n \n除直系亲属（您 的配偶、父母或子女）外，任何帮助您准备申请的人都必须在申请的 E部分处签\n名，并提供所要求的信息。  \n \n伪证处罚  \n \n根据伪证处罚，本申请中对 所有问题的回答都是真实

您接受了直系亲属以外的人的协助，且 协助您\n的人故意不签署申请，可能会导致 裁决对您不利。 \n \n《美国法典》第 18卷第1546(a)节 规定：\n\n根据第28卷第1746节，任何人在知情的情况下宣誓，或根据伪证处罚，故意在移民法律或\n法规规定的任何申请、书面陈述或其他文件中，就重大事实做出虚假陈述，或故意提交任何\n包含此类虚假陈述的此类申请、书面陈述或其他文件，应根据本卷处以罚款或不超过 10年\n的监禁，或两者兼而有之。 \n 如果存在加重处罚的因素，最高刑期可达 25年。 \n 如果您故意在本申请中提供虚假信息，您 或本申请 填写人可能会受到《美国法典》第 18卷规定的刑\n事处罚，以及《移民和国籍法》第 274C节，即《美国法典》第 8卷第1324c节规定的民事处罚（见\n《美国法典》第 8卷第270和1270部分）。 \n \nF部分 庇护面谈时填写 （如适用）  \n 在提交此表之前，请不要在\nF部分签署您的申请 。在您的诉求相关 的面谈结束时，您 将被要求在此\n空白处签署您的申请。  \n

      "content": "I-730,\nRefugee/Asylee Relative Petition\nAlert Type info\nALERT\n: USCIS consolidated Form I-730 initial domestic processing for both refugees and asylees. Starting in January 2025, USCIS Service Center Operations Directorate (SCOPS) began transferring Form I-730 following-to-join asylee (FTJ-A) petitions to USCIS Refugee and International Operations (RIO). RIO already completes initial domestic processing for following-to-join refugee (FTJ-R) cases. SCOPS has transferred most cases to RIO for initial domestic processing but continues to process a limited number of cases they had already started processing before January 2025.\nIf you are a principal refugee admitted to the United States within the past 2 years or a principal asylee who was granted asylum within the past 2 years, you (the petitioner) may use this Form I-730, Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition, to request that your spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age (the beneficiaries) join you in the United States. In certain circumstances, unmarried children over 21 years old may be eligible for following-to-join immigration benefits. For more information, see our\nChild Status Protection Act\npage. In some cases, we may also grant a waiver of the 2-year filing deadline for humanitarian reasons. See the\nInstructions for Form I-730\nfor more information.\nREMINDER:\nPlease submit a passport-style photograph or a recently taken clear photograph of each family member you are petitioning for. If you do not provide the required photo, we may issue a request for evidence, and it could take longer to process your petition.\nForm I-730 Processing\nThe processing of Form I-730 depends on various factors, including your status as a principal asylee or principal refugee and the current location of your beneficiary. Form I-730 processing is divided into three steps:\nReceipt and initial domestic processing;\nBeneficiary interview and additional processing; and\nDepartment of State returns (as appropriate).\nReceipt and Initial Domestic Processing\nSee the Where to File section below for more information on filing Form I-730. After we receive Form I-730, USCIS Refugee and International Operations (RIO) performs initial domestic processing for initial eligibility review. Generally, USCIS processes Form I-730 petitions in the order we receive them. If we need additional evidence, we will issue you a request for evidence (RFE) and give you an opportunity to respond.\nBeneficiary Interview and Additional Processing\nOnce we complete initial domestic processing of your Form I-730, and if we determine that your relative appears eligible as a follow-to-join asylee or refugee, we will send your petition to the appropriate office to interview your spouse or child and continue processing. After receiving your petition, the interviewing office will notify you, your spouse or child, and any representative of record, and provide additional instructions.\nIf your beneficiary is located\nwithin the United States\n, we will forward the petition to the appropriate USCIS\ndomestic field office\nbased on the beneficiary’s residence. We will send you a transfer notice listing the USCIS field office. You can find more information on USCIS domestic field offices on the\nUSCIS Field Offices\npage.\nIf your beneficiary is located\noutside of the United States in a country where USCIS has an international field office with jurisdiction over your beneficiary’s location\n, we will forward the petition to the USCIS international field office. We will send you a transfer notice listing the USCIS international field office that will interview your beneficiary and complete processing. Currently, USCIS maintains international field offices in Bangladesh, China, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Mexico, Qatar, and Turkey. Please note that the USCIS Nairobi Field Office also processes following-to-join refugee (FTJ-R) petitions for beneficiaries located in Burundi and Uganda. You can find information about USCIS international offices on the\nUSCIS International Immigration Offices\npage.\nIf your beneficiary is located\noutside of the United States in a country with no USCIS international field office presence or jurisdiction\n, we will forward the petition through the Department of State’s (DOS) National Visa Center (NVC) to a U.S. embassy or consulate with jurisdiction over the beneficiary’s residence. A DOS embassy or consulate will interview and complete processing of your beneficiary on USCIS’ behalf and will determine your beneficiary’s eligibility to travel to the United States. You can find more information about U.S. embassies and consulates on the\nDOS U.S. Embassy Locator\npage, which also includes details on whether the U.S. embassy or consulate is open for interviews and additional processing.\nDepartment of State Returns\nIf DOS interviews and processes the beneficiary outside the United States and finds a basis for ineligibility, DOS will return the petition to USCIS RIO, the initial domestic processing component, for further review.\nForms and Document Downloads\nForm I-730\n(PDF, 339.63 KB)\nInstructions for Form I-730\n(PDF, 94.55 KB)\nForm Details\nEdition Date\n01/20/25\n.\nYou can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions.\nDates are listed in mm/dd/yy format.\nIf you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition.

If your beneficiary previously resided in a country without a U.S. government presence but has left that country, please update their address information, using the instructions above, so either USCIS or DOS can process them in a third country.\nOutside of Normal Processing Times Inquiry\nIf the most recent notice you received indicated that a USCIS office is processing your Form I-730, and it is taking longer than the normal processing times listed for Form I-730 petitions on our\nProcessing Times\npage, you may submit an “outside of normal processing times” inquiry for your pending Form I-730.\nFor Form I-730 petitions being processed domestically by the HART Service Center, USCIS Refugee and International Operations, or a USCIS field office, you may call the\nUSCIS Contact Center\nand submit a case inquiry.

This form is also used if you have TPS and are filing for TPS re-registration.\nDo NOT use Form I-821 to request Consideration Of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).  Form I-821D \nmust be used to request DACA.  Form I-821 is only used to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS).\nWhen Should I Use Form I-821?\nUse Form I-821 when registering initially or re-registering for TPS.\nDo I Have to Request Employment Authorization with My Form I-821?\nIf you want to request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), you must file Form I-765, Application for \nEmployment Authorization, with your Form I-821. \nYou may wait to file a Form I-765 until after USCIS decides your TPS application.  However, please note that if you wait to request an EAD until after USCIS grants TPS or approves re-registration, you will not receive your EAD (assuming you are eligible) until several weeks after you file the Form I-765.\nWho May File Form I-821?\nYou must be an eligible national of a foreign state (or a person having no nationality who last habitually resided in a foreign state) that the Secretary has designated for TPS under section 244(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).  You should check with the nearest U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office for countries currently designated for TPS and for information pertaining to re-registration periods, or visit the USCIS website at  \nwww.uscis.gov/tps.\nWho Is Eligible For TPS?\nTo be eligible for TPS, you must be admissible to the United States as an immigrant under the applicable grounds in INA section 212(a), with certain exceptions.  USCIS may grant discretionary waivers for some, but not all of the applicable inadmissibility grounds (See the What Waivers are Available For TPS section of these Instructions.)\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n10/17/2023\nForm I-821 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 2 of 15\nWhat Waivers are Available For TPS?\nUSCIS may grant discretionary waivers of certain inadmissibility grounds for humanitarian purposes, to assure \nfamily unity, or because it is otherwise in the public interest.  However, USCIS cannot waive some inadmissibility grounds, by law, including certain criminal grounds in INA sections 212(a)(2)(A-C) and national security, terrorism-related, and persecution grounds in INA sections 212(a)(3)(A-C, E).  If you are inadmissible on grounds that can be waived, you may be able to obtain a discretionary waiver.  For further information on waivers, including how to apply, see the TPS page on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/tps .  You may also wish to obtain legal advice if you \nbelieve you may be subject to any ground of inadmissibility or another TPS ineligibility ground.\nIf you are re-registering for TPS and you were already granted a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility in conjunction with \nyour prior TPS application, you do not need to seek another waiver for the same action, incident, or circumstance.  For \nexample, if on a prior TPS application, USCIS previously granted you a waiver of the health ground of inadmissibility because you had tuberculosis that was treated, you do not need to apply for another waiver for that same health incident.  However, you will need to file for a waiver if you have contracted another communicable disease for which a waiver is necessary.\nDoes My Spouse, Child, or Parent Have to File a Form I-821?\nEach person seeking TPS must apply for him or herself on a separate Form I-821.  There is no derivative TPS status, meaning that your spouse, children or parents cannot obtain TPS as a result of your approval for TPS.  They must each qualify for TPS individually.  \nHowever, USCIS may accept late initial TPS applications from certain individuals who had a qualifying relationship to \na spouse or child during the initial registration period for the TPS-designated country and that relative is also currently eligible for TPS.  Even where such a relationship exists, the applicant must still meet all other TPS eligibility requirements before USCIS may grant TPS.  Please see the TPS page on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/tps or the latest Federal \nRegister Notice regarding the TPS designation for your country for further information on late initial filing.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.  To view, print, or complete our forms, you should use the latest version of Adobe Reader, which you can download for free at http://get.adobe.com/reader/ .  If you do not have internet \naccess, you may call the USCIS Contact Center and ask that we mail a form to you.\nSignature.  You (or your signing authority) must properly complete your application.  USCIS will not accept a stamped \nor typewritten name in place of any signature on this application.  If you are under 14 years of age, your parent or legal guardian may sign the application on your behalf.  A legal guardian may also sign for a mentally incompetent person.  If your application is not signed, or if the signature is not valid, we will reject your application.  See 8 CFR 103.2(a)(7)(ii)(A). If USCIS accepts a request for adjudication and determines that it has a deficient signature, USCIS may deny the request. \nValidity of Signatures.  USCIS will consider a photocopied, faxed, or scanned copy of an original handwritten signature \nas valid for filing purposes.  The photocopy, fax, or scan must be of the original document containing the handwritten ink signature.\nFiling Fee.   See Form G-1055, Fee Schedule, available at www.uscis.gov/forms, for all information on filing fees.\nEvidence.  When you file your application, you must submit all evidence and supporting documents listed in the What \nEvidence Must You Submit and/or Specific Instructions sections of these Instructions.  You should also refer to the \nmost recently published country-specific Federal Register notice that announces the procedures for TPS registration or  \nre-registration.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n10/17/2023\nForm I-821 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 3 of 15\nBiometric Services Appointment.  USCIS may require you to appear for an interview or provide biometrics (fingerprints, \nphotograph, and/or signature) at any time to verify your identity, obtain additional information, and conduct background and security checks, including a check of criminal history records maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), before making a decision on your application or petition.  If we determine that a biometric services appointment is necessary, we will send you an appointment notice with the date, time, and location of your appointment.  If you are currently overseas, your notice will instruct you to contact a U.S. Embassy , U.S. Consulate, or USCIS office outside the \nUnited States to schedule an appointment. \nAt your biometrics appointment, you must sign an oath reaffirming that:   \n1.You provided or authorized all information in the application;\n2.You reviewed and understood all of the information contained in, and submitted with, your application; and\n3.All of this information was complete, true, and correct at the time of filing.\nFor applicants and dependents who appear before an immigration judge, failure to attend a biometric services \nappointment, without good cause, may result in the immigration judge finding that your application was abandoned, and USCIS may also deny any other application you filed with USCIS.\nIf you do not attend your biometric services appointment, we may deny your application.\nCopies.  You should submit legible photocopies of documents requested, unless the Instructions specifically state that you \nmust submit an original document.  USCIS may request an original document at the time of filing or at any time during \nprocessing of an application, petition, or request.  If USCIS requests an original document from you, it will be returned to you after USCIS determines it no longer needs your original.\nNOTE:  If you submit original documents when they are not required or requested,  USCIS or the Immigration Court \nmay destroy them after we receive them.\nTranslations.  If you submit a document with information in a foreign language, you must also submit a full English \ntranslation.  The translator must sign a certification that the English language translation is complete and accurate, and that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language into English. The certification must also include the \ntranslator’s signature, printed name, the signature date, and the translator’s contact information.\nUSCIS Contact Center.

NOTE:  If you are submitting a first-time re-registration with USCIS following an Immigration Judge or Board of \nImmigration Appeals decision granting your TPS application, please include a copy of that decision order with your Form I-821.

What documents should I submit if I was arrested, charged, and/or convicted for a criminal offense?\nIn answering any question on this form about your criminal history:\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n10/17/2023\nForm I-821 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 11 of 15\nYou have been “convicted” for immigration purposes if:\n(1) A court has entered against you a judgment of guilt; or\n(2) The court has not entered a formal judgment, but;\n(3) You were found guilty after a trial, entered a guilty or “no contest” plea, or admitted in court to facts that \nwould warrant a finding of guilt; and\n(4) The court has imposed any restrictions on your liberty, including any probation, punishment or other penalty.\n“Felony” means a crime committed in the United States, punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than one year, regardless of the term such alien actually served, if any, except:  When the offense is defined by the State as a misdemeanor and the sentence actually imposed is one year or less regardless of the term such alien actually served. Under this exception for purposes of TPS, the crime shall be treated as a misdemeanor.  See 8 C.F.R. 244.1.\nMisdemeanor means a crime committed in the United States, either:\n(1) Punishable by imprisonment for a term of one year or less, regardless of the term such alien actually \nserved, if any; or\n(2) A crime treated as a misdemeanor under the term “felony” of this section.\nFor purposes of TPS, any crime punishable by imprisonment for a maximum term of five days or less shall not be \nconsidered a felony or misdemeanor.  See 8 C.F.R. 244.1.\nPlease remember, however, that even if you were not convicted, you must provide records of any arrest or charge for a \ncriminal offense.\nA. Court Disposition Records\nIf you were ever arrested, charged, and/or convicted for a criminal offense, you will need to provide court \ndisposition records.\nProvide a certified copy of all arrest reports, court dispositions, sentencing documents, and any other relevant \ndocuments.  You may also include any mitigating evidence concerning the circumstances of your arrests or \nconvictions that you would like USCIS to consider if you have been arrested or convicted of a crime.  If you were \nplaced on probation, you must provide evidence to show that you completed your probationary period.\nYou do not need to submit documentation for traffic fines and incidents (unless the traffic fines or incidents were \nalcohol- or drug-related) that did not involve an actual arrest if the penalty was only a fine of less than $500 \nor points on your driver’s license.  However, if you were arrested for any traffic offense, provide disposition \ndocumentation, so USCIS can properly assess whether your conviction may relate to your TPS eligibility .\nNOTE:  Provide the conviction and disposition documentation even if your records were sealed, expunged, \nor otherwise cleared.  You must provide the documentation even if anyone, including a judge, law enforcement officer, or attorney, told you that you no longer have a record or that you do not have to disclose the information.  \nPlease see Item 6. about what you should submit if you are not able to obtain a true copy of the official record \nconcerning any arrest, charge, or conviction, including any records of juvenile criminal history or records that are \notherwise sealed.\nNOTE:  An adjudication of juvenile delinquency is not a “conviction” under U.S. immigration law.  However, \nif a minor is charged with a crime in a criminal court proceeding rather than being placed in a juvenile court proceeding, the charges could be relevant.  You must disclose all arrests and charges.  If any arrest or charge \nwas disposed of as a matter of juvenile delinquency, include the court or other public record that establishes this \ndisposition. \nB. Particularly Serious Crimes and Serious Nonpolitical Crimes\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n10/17/2023\nForm I-821 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 12 of 15\nIf you were ever convicted of or ever committed a “particularly serious crime” that constitutes a “danger to the \ncommunity of the United States,” or there are serious reasons for believing that you have committed “serious nonpolitical crimes” outside of the United States before your arrival in this country, you cannot be granted \nTPS.  USCIS will make the determination as to whether your crimes fall into either of these categories.  Y\n ou \nmust, however, provide information and, if available, any supporting documentation on all crimes which you \nhave committed or were convicted of in the United States or outside of this country so that USCIS can make an \nappropriate decision.  If you believe that any of your arrests or convictions were politically motivated, describe why in your supplemental statements.\n6. What if official documents are not available?\nUSCIS always prefers receiving true copies of official records.\nHowever, USCIS also understands that an applicant may not be able to obtain copies of some official records.\nYou do not need to submit an official record if you establish that the record is not available to you or your designated \nrepresentative.  (In some cases, the law will allow you to obtain your own records, but does not necessarily allow \nsomeone other than you or your designated representative to obtain the records.  If you or your representative can \nobtain the records, you must do so.)  \nOrdinarily, a certificate from the custodian of the records explaining that the records cannot be disclosed to you is \nenough.\nBut if you claim that a record is not available because of a “confidentiality” law or other reason, please submit: \n(1) A copy of your petition or motion to the court or other custodian of the record seeking permission to obtain a \ncopy to submit with your application; and\n(2) A copy of the court’s or custodian’s order denying permission, if possible.\nIf you show that you cannot obtain a copy of the official record, you can submit any secondary evidence that might be \navailable, such as copies that you or your attorney may have retained.\nIf you cannot obtain primary or secondary evidence, you must provide at least one written statement.  Each written \nstatement must:\n(1) Be from a named individual who has personal knowledge to the proceeding;\n(2) Explain the source of the individual’s personal knowledge;\n(3) Describe the nature of the proceeding, the underlying charges, and the disposition; and\n(4) Be signed by the individual under oath, affirmation, or penalty of perjury .  \nIf more than one individual provides a written statement, it must be a separate typed or written statement from each, \nthat is, two individuals cannot sign the same statement.   \nIf documents, such as identity and nationality documents, are not available to you, you may provide an affidavit \nshowing proof of unsuccessful efforts to obtain such documents, why the consular process is unavailable to you (for \nidentity documents) and affirming that you are a national of the designated state.  USCIS may require a statement \nfrom the appropriate issuing authority certifying that the document is not available.  Affidavits may also be used to \nhelp prove your date of entry into the United States and residence in the United States.\n7. Will TPS applicants need to provide fingerprints, photographs, and a signature?\nA. Yes.  Except as noted below, all applicants for initial registration, re-registration, or renewal of TPS must provide \nfingerprints, photographs, and a digital signature, which are referred to as “biometrics.”  For re-registrations, \nUSCIS may be able to re-use your previously collected biometrics for identity verifications, background checks \nand other authorized purposes.\nB. USCIS may, in its discretion, waive the collection of certain biometrics.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n10/17/2023\nForm I-821 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 13 of 15\nC. When a biometric services appointment is necessary, USCIS will send a notice to TPS applicants and re-\nregistrants scheduling them to appear at an ASC for biometrics collection.  Failure to comply with this notice may result in the denial of the TPS application.\n8. Can Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, be filed at the same time as Form I-821?\nYes.  When filing an initial TPS application with USCIS or re-registering for TPS, you can also request an \nEmployment Authorization Document (EAD) by submitting a completed Form I-765 together with your Form I-821.  If you are not requesting employment authorization, you do not need to file Form I-765.  If you want to wait to file for an EAD until after USCIS decides your TPS application, you may file the Form I-765 later if you are approved for TPS.  However, filing Form I-821 with Form I-765 helps you to receive your EAD more promptly if you are eligible for one.\nNOTE:  An EAD is not a travel document.  If your application for TPS is granted and you must travel outside \nthe United States and return, you must request an Advance Parole Document from USCIS by filing Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Reports.  USCIS will issue a Form I-512, Advance Parole Document, to you if your request is granted.  For more information on filing Form I-131, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/I-131 or call the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283.  For TTY (deaf or \nhard of hearing) call:  1-800-767-1833.\n9. May the filing fee and biometric services fee for Forms I-821 and I-765 be waived?\nYes.  If you are unable to pay the filing fee and biometric services fee, 8 CFR Section 103.7(c) states that you may \nrequest a waiver of the fees.  To request a fee waiver, a person requesting an immigration benefit must either submit a written request that the fee be waived or submit a Form I-912, Request for Fee Waiver\n .  Either form of request must be \naccompanied by documentation of your inability to pay the required fee.\nIn your request, you should indicate why you believe you are entitled to or deserving of the benefit requested, the \nreason for your inability to pay the fees, and evidence to support the reasons you give.  If your fee waiver request is denied, there is no appeal of the denial.\nWhat Evidence Must You Submit?\nYou must submit all evidence requested in these Instructions with your application.

Form G-1256 notifies the interviewee that an interpreter may learn confidential information shared between him or her and the interviewing officer.  Form G-1256 also documents that the interpreter understands the requirements for his or her role as an interpreter.  Form G-1256 reminds all parties that the interpreter must accurately, literally, and fully interpret for both the interviewee and the USCIS interviewer, and that USCIS has discretion to deny permission for the interpreter to participate for the entire interview or certain portions of the interview.\nWho Must Complete Form G-1256?\nIf you intend to provide an interpreter to assist in your communication with USCIS because you are appearing for a scheduled domestic interview and are eligible to bring an interpreter to your interview with USCIS, please review this form and bring it with you to the interview.\nWhen Should I Complete Form G-1256?\nBefore the beginning of the interview, the interpreter must interpret the contents of Form G-1256 to the interviewee.  Form G-1256 may be obtained online before the interview or from the USCIS Officer at the time of the interview.\nAt the beginning of the interview, the USCIS officer will confirm that the interviewee fully understands the contents of the document.  \nThe officer will complete the form and will ask the interviewee and interpreter to sign Form G-1256 in the officer's presence.  The officer will place the completed Form G-1256 in the interviewee's file.\nGeneral Instructions\nThe interpreter must be fluent in English and in a language understood by the interviewee; competent to interpret in accordance with guidance provided by the USCIS officer at the interview; and impartial and unbiased throughout the interview.  The interviewing USCIS officer will make the determination as to whether the proposed interpreter meets these core qualifications and may decline to permit the individual to interpret if at any time the officer, in his or her discretion, determines that the interpreter is not meeting these criteria.  The interpreter also must be at least 18 years of age and cannot be a witness in the interviewee's case.  If the interviewee demonstrates good cause for a discretionary exception, USCIS may allow individuals 14 through 17 years of age and persons who are witnesses in the case to be interpreters.  Attorneys and accredited representatives cannot serve simultaneously as interpreters for their clients during the interview.\nIf USCIS declines to permit your proposed interpreter to interpret for you at the interview, you will be offered an opportunity to \nproceed with the interview with another acceptable interpreter, reschedule the interview in order for you to obtain an acceptable interpreter, or to proceed voluntarily with the interview without an interpreter.\nUSCIS Privacy Act Statement\nAUTHORITIES:   The information requested on this form, and the associated evidence, is collected under the Immigration and \nNationality Act (INA), section 103(a)(3). \nPURPOSE:  The primary purpose for providing the requested information on this form is to provide your consent and understanding \nthat any personal information that you disclose during an interview to seek an immigration benefit will be heard by an interpreter.

The employer \nmust complete and sign the relevant sections of the petition and relevant attachments.A CW-1 Worker is an alien worker who will enter or remain in the CNMI for the purpose of employment during the \ntransition period, and is ineligible for another classification under the INA.  In order to obtain the status, the worker must either be lawfully present in the CNMI, or must be coming from abroad to the CNMI with a CW-1 visa.  The worker cannot be present in the United States, other than in the CNMI.\nThe CW-1 classification is only available during the transition period.  The transition period is the period beginning on the \ntransition program effective date, November 28, 2009, and ending on December 31, 2029.\nThere is a numerical limitation (cap) on how many CW-1 workers may be admitted to the CNMI annually.\n\nForm I-129CW Instructions   01/20/25    Page 4 of 12\nThe worker is lawfully present in the CNMI if the worker was lawfully admitted to the CNMI under the immigration \nlaws of the CNMI prior to November 28, 2009 and is still within the authorized period of stay, or was lawfully admitted or paroled into the CNMI under federal immigration laws on or after November 28, 2009, other than an alien admitted or paroled as a visitor for business or pleasure (B-1 or B-2) or under any visa-free travel provision including but not limited to the parole program for certain visitors from Russia and the People’ s Republic of China.\nThe CW-1 employer must be a legitimate business.  A legitimate business is a real, active, and operating commercial or entrepreneurial undertaking that produces services or goods for profit, or is a governmental, charitable, or other validly recognized nonprofit entity.  The business must meet applicable legal requirements for doing business in the CNMI and have substantially complied with wage and hour laws, occupational safety and health requirements, nondiscrimination, and all other Federal, CNMI, and local requirements relating to employment during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the petition, and continues to be in substantial compliance with such requirements.  A business \nwill not be considered legitimate if it engages directly or indirectly in, or knowingly benefits from, prostitution, human trafficking, or any other activity that is illegal under Federal, CNMI, or local law .  The U.S. Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity will determine whether a business is legitimate. \nCW\n-1 Long-Term Worker.  A CW-1 long-term worker is defined as “an alien who was admitted to the CNMI, or \notherwise granted status, as a CW-1 nonimmigrant during fiscal year 2015, and during each of fiscal years 2016 through \n2018.”  If you are requesting a long-term CW-1 worker, select “Yes” to Part 2., Item Number 6.a. and respond to Item Number 6.b.\nNOTE:  If you are requesting long-term CW-1 workers, you must also provide evidence showing that each worker \nwas admitted as a CW-1 during fiscal year 2015 (Oct. 1, 2014 - Sept. 30, 2015), and during every subsequent fiscal year through fiscal year 2018.  Such evidence may be in the form of Form I-94 Arrival/Departure documents or USCIS \napproval notices.\nValidity Period.  If eligible to be classified as a CW-1 long-term worker, a validity period of up to 3 years may be \ngranted.  All other CW-1 nonimmigrants may be granted a validity period of up to 1 year. \nTotal number of workers.  The total number of workers you request on a CW-1 petition must not exceed the number of \nworkers approved by the Department of Labor on the temporary labor certification.  \nIncluding more than one worker in a petition.  You may include multiple workers who seek admission in the CW-1 \nclassification on the same petition provided you are requesting the same action for each, and all the workers will:\n1. Be working in the same occupational category;\n2. Be working under the same terms and conditions;\n3. Be employed for the same period of time; and\n4. Be employed in the same location(s).\nNOTE:  Petitioners may not request regular CW-1 workers and long-term CW-1 workers on the same petition.\nFiling Multiple Petitions\nYou generally may file one petition to request all of your CW-1 workers associated with one temporary labor certification.  \nEven in cases where filing a separate petition is not required, it may still be advantageous to file more than one CW -1 \npetition.  This can occur when you petition for multiple workers, some of whom may not qualify for part or all of the validity period you request.  This most frequently occurs when at least one worker is not eligible for the maximum amount of time.  (See “ Limitation of Stay” information below.)  \nIf we request additional evidence because of this situation, it may delay petition processing.  Filing separate petitions for workers who are not affected by such considerations may enable you to quickly obtain some workers, if they are otherwise eligible, in the event that the petition for your other workers is delayed.\n\nForm I-129CW Instructions   01/20/25    Page 5 of 12\nIf you decide to file more than one petition with the same temporary labor certification, you may do so if:\n1. Each petition is accompanied by a copy of the approved temporary labor certification; and\n2. The total number of beneficiaries on your petitions does not exceed the total number of workers approved by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor on the temporary labor certification.\nNaming beneficiaries.   All workers in a petition for CW-1 classification, an extension of stay, or change of status must be \nnamed in the petition.  Unnamed beneficiaries are not permitted.\nAdditional Worker Attachment for Form I-129CW.  Include a separate Additional Worker Attachment to Form \nI-129CW for each additional worker when more than one worker is included in the petition.  Do not include the person you named in Part 3. Worker Information on Form I-129CW.  You must also submit the appropriate fee.\nNOTE:  Part 6. Employer Attestation requires an attestation by the petitioning employer with the appropriate documentation.  The authorizing official of the petitioning employer must complete, sign, and date the Employer Attestation.  The attestation certifies, under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America, that the contents of the attestation and the evidence submitted with it are true and correct for the worker included on the Form I-129CW and EVERY worker named in an Additional Worker Attachment.  The attestation is subject to verification.\nTen-Day Admission Requirement.  If the worker is outside the CNMI or is approved for consular processing, he or she \nmust apply for admission within 10 days after the beginning of the petition validity period.\nLimitation of Stay.  A worker (other than a CW-1 long-term worker) may not be granted CW-1 status beyond three \nconsecutive petition validity periods unless the worker has departed and remained outside of the United States for a continuous period of at least 30 days after the expiration of the third petition validity period and before the filing of a new petition.\nLiability for Return Transportation.  Under 8 CFR 214.2(w)(11), a petitioning employer is liable for the reasonable cost \nof return transportation for a CW-1 Worker who is dismissed before the end of the period of authorized employment.\nGovernor’s Cap Reservation.  USCIS sets aside a number of CW-1 permits for certain occupational categories per fiscal \nyear, as recommended by the Governor of the CNMI.  The reserved CW-1 numbers will be made available to eligible petitioners requesting such numbers for a fiscal year in order of filing until exhausted.  See 8 CFR 214.2(w)(1)(x)(D)(2).  Unused reserved numbers will not be available to other petitioners.  USCIS publishes current information regarding the governor’s cap reservation on the website at www.uscis.gov and provides notice of changes via Federal Register Notice.\nE-Verify and CW-1 Petitions.  Only employers who participate in good standing in the E-Verify program may file a Form I-129CW petition for a CW-1 worker.  E-Verify is a web-based system that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States.  E-Verify employers verify the identity and employment eligibility of newly hired employees by electronically matching information provided by employees on the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, against records available to the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  Provide your E-Verify Company ID or Client Company ID.  For more information on E-Verify visit www.e-verify.gov.\nSee 8 CFR 274a.12(b)(21) for more information on this requirement.\nInitial Evidence\nThe initial evidence listed below and the initial evidence listed under the instructions for an initial grant of status, a change \nof status, or an extension of stay must be included with a petition, as appropriate.\n\nForm I-129CW Instructions   01/20/25    Page 6 of 12\nAdditionally, the petitioner must submit:\n1.

However, under the CNMI-Only Transitional Worker regulations the petitioner may in certain situations request that the alien be granted an initial CW-1 status in the CNMI.  This will allow certain workers who were present in the CNMI prior to the transition date to be granted an initial  CW-1 status without \nhaving to depart the CNMI.  Additionally, a worker who is currently in parole status in the CNMI may also be granted an initial CW-1 status in the CNMI.\nA petition for a grant of initial CW-1 status for a worker currently in the CNMI whose lawful status is solely based upon \na CNMI issued permit must have been filed on or before November 27, 201 1.

If the beneficiary is in the \nUnited States and would like to extend or change nonimmigrant status, file this petition at the USCIS service center that \napproved the blanket L petition along with Form I-129.\nCitizens of Canada under NAFTA.  Petitioners who seek L-1 classification for citizens of Canada under the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) may also have the beneficiary present Form I-129S to a CBP officer in conjunction with an application for admission.  The beneficiary may do this at either:\n1. A “Class A” port-of-entry located on the U.S./Canada land border; or\n2. A U.S. pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station in Canada.\nCertification Pertaining to the Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons  in the United States\nU.S. Export Controls on the Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons.  The Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 770-774) and the International Traffic in \n Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 \nCFR Parts 120-130) require U.S. persons to seek and receive authorization from the U.S. Government before releasing to foreign persons in the United States controlled technology or technical data.  Under both the EAR and the IT AR, release \nof controlled technology or technical data to foreign persons in the United States, even by an employer , is deemed as \nan export to that person’s country or countries of citizenship or nationality.  One implication of this rule is that a U.S. company must seek and receive a license from the U.S. Government before it releases controlled technology or technical data to its nonimmigrant workers employed as L-1 beneficiaries.\n\nForm I-129S Instructions   01/20/25 Page 6 of 7\nRequirement to Certify Compliance with U.S. Export Control Regulations.  The U.S. Government requires each \ncompany or other entity to certify that it has reviewed the EAR and IT AR and determine whether it will require a U.S. \nGovernment export license to release controlled technology or technical data to the beneficiary .  If an export license \nis required, then the company or other entity must further certify that it will not release or otherwise provide access to controlled technology or technical data to the beneficiary until it has received from the U.S. Government the required authorization to do so.  The petitioner must indicate whether or not a license is required on Part 6. Certification \nRegarding the Release of Controlled Technology or Technical Data to Foreign Persons in the United States.   \nControlled Technology and Technical Data.  The licensing requirements described above will affect only a small \npercentage of petitioners because most types of technology are not controlled for export or release to foreign persons.  \nThe technology and technical data that are, however, controlled for export or release to foreign persons are identified on the EAR’s Commerce Control List (CCL) and the ITAR’s U.S. Munitions List (USML).  The CCL is found at 15 CFR 774, Supp. 1 and www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-774.  The USML is found at 22 CFR 121.1 and www.ecfr.gov/current/title-22/chapter-I/subchapter-M/part-121 .  The EAR-controlled \ntechnology on the CCL generally pertains to that which is for the production, development, or use of what are generally known as “dual-use” items.  The ITAR-controlled technical data on the USML generally pertains to that which is directly related to defense articles.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administers the CCL and is responsible \nfor issuing licenses for the release to foreign persons of technology controlled under the EAR.  The U.S. Department \nof State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) administers the USML and is responsible for issuing licenses for the release to foreign persons of technical data controlled under the IT AR.  Information about the EAR and how to \napply for a license from BIS are at www.bis.doc.gov.  Specific information about EAR’s requirements pertaining to \nthe release of controlled technology to foreign persons is at www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/policy-guidance/deemed-\nexports.  Information about the ITAR and how to apply for a license from DDTC are at www.pmddtc.state.gov.  Specific \ninformation about the ITAR’s requirements pertaining to the release of controlled technical data can be found on DDTC’s Frequently Asked Questions page at www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_public_portal_faq_landing by reviewing the Topic Area “Licensing of Foreign Persons.”\nAddress Change\nA petitioner or beneficiary who is not a U.S. citizen must notify USCIS of their new address within 10 days of moving from their previous residence.

The fee is $1,000 for FY 2025 and is subject to annual adjustments for inflation. Do\nnot\npay the immigration parole fee when you submit Form I-131 to USCIS. Beginning on Oct. 16, 2025, if you are in the United States and we determine that we can approve your request for parole or re-parole and that it requires payment of the immigration parole fee, we will notify you that you must pay this fee before we can approve your request. The notice we send you will contain payment instructions and a deadline. We will not grant parole unless you pay the immigration parole fee as instructed and within the specified time period.\nSee our\nweb alert\nfor more information.\nAlert Type info\nALERT: Re-Parole Process for Certain Ukrainian Citizens and Their Immediate Family Members\nOn Feb. 27, 2024, we\nannounced\na process for eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to apply for re-parole so they can continue to temporarily remain in the United States.\nWe encourage eligible Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to submit their re-parole requests to us no earlier than\n180 days (6 months) before the expiration of their current period of parole\n. You can find your parole expiration date on your\nForm I-94, Arrival/Departure Record\n, issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when you were paroled into the United States.\nFiling during this window reduces the risk that your current period of parole and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your re-parole request.\nIf you submit a request for re-parole more than 180 days before the expiration of your current period of parole, we may reject or deny your re-parole application without refunding the filing fees\n. Please note that filing earlier than 180 days before your current parole expiration date will not result in a faster decision.\nUse this form to apply for travel documents, parole documents, or arrival/departure records.\nTravel Documents\nYou may use this form to apply for a reentry permit, refugee travel document, TPS travel authorization document, advance parole document, or advance permission to travel for Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) long-term residents.\nIf we approve your Form I-131 and you are a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiary in the United States who wishes to travel outside the United States, we will issue you Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by an Alien to the United States.\nIf we approve your Form I-131 and your initial application for TPS (Form I-821) is still pending, we will issue you a Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document.\nIf you are a TPS beneficiary or have a pending initial TPS application, you should carefully read the Form I-131 Instructions. These instructions explain certain risks you may face if you are outside the United States while we are considering your TPS re-registration or initial application, such as missing important requests for evidence or other notices or being denied TPS while you are outside the United States.\nFor information on travel documents, including potential immigration-related consequences of traveling outside the United States, see our\nTravel Documents\npage. If you are in the United States and you have an urgent need to travel outside the United States, see our\nExpedite Requests\npage and\nEmergency Travel\npage.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will determine at its discretion during inspection whether you may be admitted into TPS. You may be admitted into TPS if you travel and return in accordance with your TPS travel authorization, your TPS remains valid, and you are not inadmissible for certain criminal or security grounds that are mandatory ineligibility grounds for TPS.\nNote that if you were previously granted parole, this admission will render you ineligible for a new period of parole (re-parole).\nIf you file this form to request advance permission to travel for CNMI long-term residents, and you leave the CNMI without having an advance permission to travel document, your status will automatically terminate.\nInitial Parole Documents\nYou may use this form to apply for parole into the United States for yourself or someone else who is an alien and who is currently outside the United States based on urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. A parole request from outside the United States may fall under an existing program or process, such as the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program, parole under the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, or the Family Reunification Task Force (FRTF) process. Your initial parole document may be a boarding foil that is placed in your passport, or it may be a Form I-512L travel document.\nArrival/Departure Records for Parole in Place\nIf you are an alien who is currently inside the United States and you are present without having been admitted, you may use this form to apply for parole in place based on urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit, including requests for military parole in place and the FRTF process.\nArrival/Departure Records for Re-Parole\nIf you are an alien who is inside the United States, who was previously granted parole, and who needs an additional period of parole, then you may use this form to apply for re-parole based on urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit. If we authorize your re-parole, you will be issued a Form I-94 Arrival/Departure Record with a new Admit Until Date or Parole Until Date.\nGenerally, the DHS component that initially authorized parole has jurisdiction over any request for re-parole, unless DHS or USCIS provides alternate filing instructions. Please see the\nMemorandum of Agreement between USCIS, ICE, and CBP\nfor more information about each agency’s jurisdiction over re-parole requests. Form I-131 includes filing instructions for specific types of re-parole requests processed by USCIS.\nYour re-parole request may fall under an existing program or process, such as for those who were initially paroled under the family reunification parole processes, certain Afghans paroled into the United States after July 31, 2021, certain Ukrainians paroled into the United States after Feb. 11, 2022, the Filipino World War II Veterans Parole Program, Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative, Central American Minors Program, FRTF Process, or military parole in place.\nFile Online\nForm Details\nForms and Document Downloads\nForm I-131\n(PDF, 637.69 KB)\nInstructions for Form I-131\n(PDF, 657.62 KB)\nEdition Date\n01/20/25\n.\nYou can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions.\nDates are listed in mm/dd/yy format.\nIf you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition.

If we approve Form I-131, filed by a lawful permanent resident or conditional permanent resident seeking a Reentry Permit, we will issue a Reentry Permit.\nRefugee Travel Documents\nDHS may issue a Refugee Travel Document to an alien in valid refugee or asylee status, or to a lawful permanent resident \nwho obtained such status as a direct result of refugee or asylee status in the United States, so that they may seek admission upon their return from a trip abroad. In addition, aliens who hold asylee or refugee status and are not lawful permanent residents must have a Refugee Travel Document to reenter the United States after traveling abroad unless they possess an Advance Parole Document. If we approve a Form I-131 filed by an alien in valid refugee or asylee status (or a lawful permanent resident who obtained such status as a direct result of refugee or asylee status) to obtain a Refugee Travel Document, we will issue a Refugee Travel Document which authorizes them to seek admission upon their return from a trip abroad.\nA DHS officer at the Port of Entry will determine the alien’s admissibility when they present their Refugee Travel \nDocument upon return from their trip abroad.\nTravel Authorization Documents for TPS Beneficiaries Inside the United States\nDHS may grant discretionary travel authorization to aliens who have been granted TPS. If we approve Form I-131 for \na TPS beneficiary seeking travel authorization, we will issue Form I-512T, Authorization for Travel by an Alien to the United States, to serve as evidence of DHS’s prior consent to their travel outside the United States under the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) section 244(f)(3). DHS will determine at inspection whether you may be admitted into TPS. If you travel and return in accordance with your TPS travel authorization and your TPS remains valid, you will be admitted into TPS as long as you are not inadmissible for certain criminal or security grounds that are mandatory ineligibility grounds for TPS.\nAdvance Parole Document for Aliens Who Are Currently Inside the United States and Advance Permission to Travel \nfor CNMI Long-Term Residents\nDHS may, as a matter of discretion, issue an Advance Parole Document under the general parole authority of INA section \n212(d)(5)(A) to an alien who is inside the United States and who seeks to be able to request parole under INA  section \n212(d)(5)(A) upon return from a trip abroad. If we approve Form I-131 for an alien inside the United States seeking an Advance Parole Document, we will issue a Form I-512/I-512L, Advance Parole Document, which authorizes the alien to present themselves at a Port of Entry to seek parole into the United States under INA  section 212(d)(5)(A) temporarily for \nurgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 2 of 30\nDHS may, in its discretion, grant advance permission to travel for CNMI long-term residents, who are otherwise not \npermitted to travel to the rest of the United States. If we approve Form I-131 for a CNMI long-term resident, USCIS will issue an Advance Parole Document as evidence of advance permission to travel for CNMI long-term residents, which allows them to travel to any other part of the United States for temporary and legitimate purposes without automatically terminating their CNMI long-term resident status. CNMI long-term residents must obtain advance permission before departing the CNMI to travel to any other part of the United States (including Guam). Any travel in violation of these restrictions will result in the automatic termination of status. Travel to or from a foreign place through a direct transit in Guam does not require advance permission.\nA transportation company may accept Advance Parole Documents in place of a visa as an authorization to travel to the \nUnited States.\nWARNINGS FOR ADV ANCE PAROLE DOCUMENTS:\n• An Advance Parole Document is not issued to serve in place of any required passport. An Advance Parole Document \ncannot be used solely to circumvent normal visa issuance procedures and is not a means to bypass delays in visa issuance.\n• An Advance Parole Document issued to an alien while they are inside the United States does not entitle that alien to be paroled into the United States upon their return from a trip abroad. A separate discretionary decision on their request for parole into the United States under INA section 212(d)(5)(A) will be made when they arrive at a Port of Entry and apply for admission to the United States upon their return.\n• DHS may revoke or terminate an Advance Parole Document at any time, including while the alien is outside the United States, in which event the alien may be unable to return to the United States unless they have a valid visa or other document that allows them to travel to the United States and seek admission.\n• If the alien is applying for an Advance Parole Document based on their immigration status, being granted deferred action, or being covered under Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), and they leave the United States without first obtaining an Advance Parole Document, they may no longer be eligible for that immigration status, deferred action, or being covered under DED and may not be permitted to return to the United States. \n• If the alien is applying for an Advance Parole Document based on being a parolee under INA section 212(d)(5)(A), even if they obtain an Advance Parole Document before they leave the United States, their parole will automatically terminate when they leave the United States.\nConsequences of Failure to Obtain Advance Parole Document for Certain Aliens Who Are Currently Inside the United States\nIf an alien is inside the United States and has filed Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust \nStatus, we generally will consider their Form I-485 abandoned if they leave the United States without first obtaining an \nAdvance Parole Document. \nGenerally\n, we will not consider the Form I-485 as abandoned, even if the alien does not obtain an Advance Parole \nDocument before traveling abroad while their application is pending, if they are in one of the following classifications and \nremain eligible for and would be admissible in one of the following categories upon applying for admission at a Port of Entry:\n1. An H-1 nonimmigrant temporary worker, or H-4 spouse or child of an H-1;\n2. An L-1 nonimmigrant intracompany transferee, or L-2 spouse or child of an L-1;\n3. A K-3 nonimmigrant spouse, or K-4 nonimmigrant child of a U.S. citizen; or\n4. A V-1 nonimmigrant spouse, or V-2/V-3 nonimmigrant child of a lawful permanent resident. \nNOTE: Upon returning to the United States, such aliens must present a valid H, L, K, or V nonimmigrant visa and must be otherwise admissible to avoid their adjustment of status application being considered abandoned. If the alien does not have an approved advance parole travel document, nor a valid or unexpired H, L, K, or V nonimmigrant visa, then they generally need to obtain an H, L, K, or V nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. Department of State (DOS) visa issuing post or \nobtain an Advance Parole Document to avoid their adjustment of status application being deemed abandoned.\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 3 of 30\nCNMI Long-Term Residents Travel Outside the United States \nThe statute establishing the CNMI long-term resident status authorizes travel between the CNMI and foreign places.  \nCNMI long-term residents are not required to obtain a grant of advance permission before traveling to a foreign country .  \nTraveling to a foreign country without obtaining a grant of advance permission will not result in abandonment of Form I-485.\nUpon returning to the United States, CNMI Long-Term Residents can only be admitted to the CNMI, except that a direct \ntransit between the CNMI and a foreign place through Guam is allowed. Travel to any other part of the United States (including Guam) requires advance permission to travel.\nInitial Parole Document for Aliens Who Are Outside the United States\nDHS may, in its discretion, issue a Parole Document under the general parole authority of INA section 212(d)(5)(A), to an \nalien outside the United States on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. If we approve Form I-131 for an alien outside the United States seeking a Parole Document, we will issue a Parole Document, which authorizes the alien to appear at a Port of Entry to seek parole into the United States under INA  section 212(d)(5)\n(A) temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\nA transportation company may accept the Parole Document in place of a visa as authorization to travel to the United \nStates.\nNOTE: Form I-131 may not be used for initial Central American Minors (CAM) Program applications on behalf of \nindividuals who have never been paroled into the United States under the CAM Program. Information on initial CAM Program applications and program eligibility can be found at www.uscis.gov/CAM.\nWARNING:  A Parole Document issued to an alien does not entitle them to be paroled into the United States. A separate \ndiscretionary decision on the request for parole into the United States under INA  section 212(d)(5)(A) will be made when \nthe alien arrives at a Port of Entry.\nArrival/Departure Record for Parole in Place for Aliens Who Are Inside the United States\nDHS, in its discretion, may grant parole in place on a case-by-case basis for ur gent humanitarian reasons or significant \npublic benefit to aliens who are present in the United States without inspection and admission. If we approve Form I-131 \nfiled for an alien seeking parole in place, the alien will receive a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, which is evidence \nof their parole in place.\nAliens inside the United States previously granted parole in place may request a new period of parole, also known as re-\nparole. Please refer to the Arrival/Departure Record for Re-parole section below for additional information.\nArrival/Departure Record for Re-parole (New Period of Parole for Parolees Who Are Inside the United States)\nDHS may, in its discretion, grant a new period of parole, also known as re-parole, to aliens inside the United States who \nwere previously paroled into the United States under INA  section 212(d)(5)(A) for ur\ngent humanitarian reasons or for \nsignificant public benefit. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may require aliens seeking re-parole to submit biometrics, appear for an interview, or complete an immigration medical examination and submit the results to USCIS.\nIf we approve Form I-131 for an alien seeking re-parole, we will issue a Form I-94, Arrival/Departure Record, which is \nevidence of their re-parole. \nWho May File Form I-131?\nA separate Form I-131 must be filed for each alien seeking a travel document, Parole Document, or Arrival/Departure \nRecord.\nDo not file Form I-131 if the alien is seeking release via parole from immigration custody . The alien should contact U.S. \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) about the request.\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 4 of 30\nICE generally has jurisdiction over Form I-131 requests when the alien applicant or beneficiary is in exclusion, \ndeportation, or removal proceedings, is subject to an administratively final exclusion, deportation, or removal order , or has \npreviously been ordered excluded, deported, or removed from the United States.\nDuplicate Form I-131 RequestsDo not file duplicate Form I-131 requests of the same application type for the same beneficiary . \n We may reject, deny, \nadministratively close, or terminate a duplicate Form I-131 if a previously submitted Form I-131 with the same applicant \nor petitioner and beneficiary is pending with that same application type.\n1. Reentry Permit\nA. Applying for a Reentry Permit\nLawful permanent residents and conditional permanent residents may apply for a Reentry Permit. The alien must \nbe physically present in the United States when they file the Reentry Permit application and complete the biometric \nservices requirement. After filing the application for a Reentry Permit, USCIS will inform the alien in writing when to go to their local Application Support Center (ASC) for their biometric services appointment. (See Item 9. Biometrics \nServices Requirement in the Required Evidence section of these Instructions.)\nNOTE: A Reentry Permit may be sent to a U.S. Embassy, U.S. Consulate, or USCIS international field office abroad \nfor the alien to pick up, if they make such a request when they file their application. Please note that an alien may \nnot be able to pick up their Reentry Permit at all U.S. Embassies and U.S. Consulates, as available services may be \nlimited at some locations.\nIf an alien possesses a valid Reentry Permit, we will not consider them to have abandoned their status as a lawful \npermanent resident or conditional permanent resident based solely on the duration of their absences from the United \nStates while the permit is valid. Nonetheless, a Reentry Permit does not exempt an alien from compliance with any \nof the requirements of U.S. immigration laws; only a returning resident visa obtained abroad from a U.S. Embassy or \nU.S. Consulate provides exemption from such compliance.\nAn absence from the United States for 1 year or more will generally break the continuity of an alien’ s required \ncontinuous residence for the purpose of naturalization. If an alien intends to remain outside the United States for 1 \nyear or more, they may be eligible to file Form N-470, Application to Preserve Residence for Naturalization Purposes. \nFor more information, call the USCIS Contact Center at 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833). The USCIS Contact \nCenter provides information in English and Spanish.\nB. Validity of Reentry Permit\n(1) Generally, a Reentry Permit issued to a lawful permanent resident is valid for 2 years from the date of \nissuance. See 8 CFR section 223.3(a)(1). However, if the alien has been outside the United States for more \nthan 4 of the last 5 years since becoming a lawful permanent resident, we will limit the permit to 1 year. As an \nexception, we may issue a permit with a validity of 2 years to:\n(a) A lawful permanent resident whose travel is on the order of the U.S. Government, other than an exclusion, deportation, removal, or rescission order;\n(b) A lawful permanent resident employed by a public international organization of which the United States \nis a member by treaty or statute; or\n(c) A lawful permanent resident who is a professional athlete and regularly competes in the United States and \nworldwide.\n(2) A Reentry Permit issued to a conditional permanent resident may be valid until the dated the conditional \nresident status will expire, not to exceed 2 years.\n(3) USCIS will not extend the validity of a Reentry Permit.\nC. We will not issue a Reentry Permit to an alien if:\n(1) The alien has already been issued such a document, and it is still valid, unless the prior document has been \nreturned to USCIS or the alien can demonstrate that it was lost; or\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 5 of 30\n(2) A notice was published in the Federal Register that precludes the issuance of such a document for travel to the \narea where the alien intends to go.\nNotice to lawful permanent residents or conditional permanent residents concerning possible abandonment of status: If the alien does not obtain a Reentry Permit, lengthy or frequent absences from the United States could be factors supporting a conclusion that the alien has abandoned their lawful permanent resident or conditional permanent resident status. If DHS determines, upon their return to the United States, that the alien has abandoned their lawful permanent resident or conditional permanent resident status, the alien may challenge that determination if they are placed in removal proceedings.\n2. Refugee Travel Document\nA. If the alien is in the United States and (1) in valid refugee or asylee status based on INA sections 207 or 208 \nor (2) if the alien is a lawful permanent resident as a direct result of their refugee or asylee status in the United \nStates, they may apply for a Refugee Travel Document.  The alien must apply  BEFORE they leave the United \nStates.  If we require biometrics, the alien must appear for any required biometric services appointment \nBEFORE they leave the United States.  If they fail to appear for biometrics collection, we may deny their \napplication.\nWhen filing for a refugee travel document, applicants are advised to carefully review the filing instructions \nprovided at www.uscis.gov/i-131-addresses, and ensure that the application is sent to the correct filing location \nor office. Misfiled applications will result in delays in processing and may result in denial or rejection of the \napplication for a refugee travel document.\nAfter filing the application, USCIS will inform the alien in writing when to go to their local USCIS ASC for their \nbiometric services appointment. Unless they have other appropriate documentation, such as a Permanent Resident \nCard (commonly known as a Green Card) and passport, the alien must have a Refugee T ravel Document to return \nto the United States after temporary travel abroad.\nB. If the alien is outside of the United States and (1) has valid refugee or asylee status or (2) the alien is a lawful \npermanent resident as a direct result of their refugee or asylee status in the United States, then, we may allow \nthe alien, in our discretion, to file Form I-131 and apply for a Refugee T ravel Document.  USCIS will make the \ndecision whether to accept the application. \nThe alien must file their application within 1 year of their last departure from the United States and should \ninclude an explanation of why they failed to apply for a Refugee Travel Document before they departed from the \nUnited States.\nTravel Warning Regarding Voluntary Re-availment\nWARNING to asylees who travel to the country of claimed persecution: If an alien applied for asylum on or \nafter April 1, 1997, their asylum status may be terminated if it is determined that they have voluntarily availed \nthemselves of the protection of their country of nationality or, if stateless, country of last habitual residence. See \nINA section 208(c)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. 1158(c)(2)(D).\nC. Validity of Refugee Travel Document\n(1) A Refugee Travel Document is valid for 1 year.\n(2) The validity date of a Refugee a Travel Document cannot be extended.\nD. A Refugee Travel Document may not be issued to an alien if:\n(1) The alien has already been issued such a document and it is still valid, unless the prior document has been \nreturned to USCIS or the alien can demonstrate that it was lost or destroyed; or\n(2) A notice was published in the Federal Register that precludes the issuance of such a document for travel to the \narea where the alien intends to go.\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 6 of 30\nNOTE: The alien should apply for a Refugee Travel Document before they leave the United States. However, we can \nsend a Refugee Travel Document to a U.S. Embassy, U.S. Consulate, or USCIS international field office for the alien to pick up, if the alien makes such a request when they file their application. Please note that the alien may not be able \nto pick up their Refugee Travel Document at all U.S. Embassies and U.S. Consulates, as available services may be \nlimited at some locations. Departing from the United States before we make a decision on the application usually does \nnot affect the decision. However, if we require biometrics and the alien departs the United States before biometrics are \ncollected, we may deny the application.\nNotice to lawful permanent residents who obtain permanent residence as a result of their refugee or asylee \nstatus: If the alien does not obtain a Reentry Permit (see Item 1. Reentry Permit  above) and remains outside the \nUnited States, lengthy or frequent absences from the United States could be factors supporting a conclusion that the alien has abandoned their lawful permanent resident status. With the exception of having to obtain a returning resident visa abroad, a Reentry Permit does not exempt an alien from complying with any U.S. immigration laws. If the alien possesses a valid, unexpired Reentry Permit, we will not consider them to have abandoned their status as a lawful permanent resident or conditional permanent resident based solely on the duration of their absences from the United States while the permit is valid.\nNotice to lawful permanent residents applying for naturalization: An absence from the United States for 1 year \nor more will generally break the continuity of an alien’s required continuous residence for purpose of naturalization. \nIf the alien intends to remain outside the United States for 1 year or more, they may be eligible to file Form N-470, \nApplication to Preserve Residence for Naturalization Purposes. For more information, call the USCIS Contact Center \nat 800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833).\nAbandonment of lawful permanent residence: If DHS determines, upon the alien’s return to the United States, that \nthe alien has abandoned their lawful permanent resident status, they may challenge that determination if the alien is \nplaced in removal proceedings, and seeks a determination whether the alien may retain asylum status even if they \ncannot retain lawful permanent resident status.\n3. Travel Authorization Related to Temporary Protected Status (TPS)\nA. Travel Authorization for TPS Beneficiaries\nIf the alien is a current TPS beneficiary, they should select Part 1., Item Number 4. of the application to request \nTPS travel authorization under INA section 244(f)(3).\nIf an alien has TPS and returns to the United States with DHS’s prior travel authorization, DHS will determine \nupon inspection whether the alien may be admitted into TPS. If the alien travels and returns in accordance with \nTPS travel authorization, the the alien will be admitted in the same immigration status they had at the time of \ndeparture if their TPS is still valid and unless they are determined to be inadmissible under  certain criminal or \nsecurity grounds that are also mandatory grounds of ineligibility for TPS. In such a case, the alien may be placed \nin removal proceedings, and TPS may be withdrawn. See Section 304(c)(1) of the Miscellaneous and Technical \nImmigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), Pub. L. 102-232, 105 Stat. 1733, 1749, as \namended (8 U.S.C. 1254a note). \nB. General Notes Relating to Travel\nTravel abroad by an alien granted TPS who has an outstanding order of removal or is in removal proceedings may \nhave legal consequences with respect to the removal order or proceedings. If you are under removal proceedings, which includes an unexecuted final order of removal before you leave the United States on your TPS-related \ntravel document, then you return subject to such proceedings and, if applicable, any such removal order . \n An alien \nmay wish to obtain independent legal advice before leaving the United States if they are in this situation.\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 7 of 30\nIf an alien has a pending re-registration application for TPS and they leave the United States, they may miss \nimportant notices from USCIS regarding their application, including requests for additional evidence. If the alien does not respond timely to these notices, USCIS may deem their application abandoned and deny the application. \nTheir TPS may also be withdrawn. It is very important that the alien makes appropriate arrangements to ensure \nthat they do not miss any such important notices, including creating an account at https://my.uscis.gov if they \nhave not already done so. An alien can use their USCIS online account to send secure messages, check the status of their cases, respond to Requests for Evidence (RFEs), verify their identity , and receive details on decisions for \ntheir case. Instructions for creating an online account can be found at https://www.uscis.gov/file-online/how-to-\ncreate-a-uscis-online-account.\n4. Advance Parole Document for Aliens Who Are Inside the United States\nAn alien inside the United States should select the appropriate box in Part 1., Item Number 5. of the application \nif any of the items listed under Item A. below apply. \nA. Advance Parole Document Filing Population\nIf the alien is inside the United States and seeks an Advance Parole Document authorizing them to seek \nparole at a Port of Entry for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit upon their return from a trip abroad, they may apply for an Advance Parole Document if:\n(1) The alien has a pending Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status;\n(2) The alien has a pending affirmative Form I-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal;\n(3) The alien has a pending initial Form I-821, Application for Temporary Protected Status (TPS);\n(4) The alien is covered under Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) and DHS provided discretionary travel \nauthorization as a benefit of DED for their country; or\n(5) The alien has been granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) (Form I-821D) pursuant to the \nregulations at 8 CFR 236.21-236.23. USCIS may, in its discretion, issue an Advance Parole Document if the \nalien is traveling outside the United States for educational purposes, employment purposes, or humanitarian \npurposes.\nNOTE: Travel for vacation is not a valid purpose. For purposes of requests for advance parole by DACA \nrecipients:\n(a) Educational purposes include, but are not limited to, semester abroad programs or academic research;\n(b) Employment purposes include, but are not limited to, overseas assignments, interviews, conferences, \ntraining, or meetings with clients; and\n(c) Humanitarian purposes include, but are not limited to, travel to obtain medical treatment, attend funeral \nservices for a family member, or visit an ailing relative.\n(6) The alien has been granted T or U nonimmigrant status (Form I-914 or Form I-918);\n(7) The alien is currently paroled in the United States under INA section 212(d)(5)(A);\n(8) USCIS has granted the alien’s Application for Family Unity Benefits (Form I-817);\n(9) The alien has a pending application for temporary resident status pursuant to INA section 245A  (Form I-687);\n(10) The alien has been granted V nonimmigrant status (per the Immigration Family Equity (LIFE) Act) in the \nUnited States;\n(11)  The alien has been granted Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) long-term resident status \nAND they seek to travel to any other part of the United States (including Guam), except to travel in direct \ntransit between the CNMI and a foreign place through Guam; or\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 8 of 30\n(a) If the alien has been granted CNMI long-term resident status pursuant to Public Law 116-24, Northern \nMariana Islands Long-Term Legal Residents Relief Act (48 U.S.C. 1806(e)(6)), they may apply for advance permission to travel;\n(b) If the alien is in the CNMI and they have been granted CNMI long-term resident status, they must obtain advance permission to travel before departing the CNMI to travel to any other part of the United States \n(including Guam). Travel between the CNMI and a foreign place through a direct transit in Guam does \nnot require advance permission;\n(c) To request advance permission to travel, the alien must file Form I-131, in accordance with the filing \ninstructions contained in this document.\n(d) Along with their completed Form I-131, and proof of CNMI long-term resident status, the alien must also \ninclude a statement describing:\n• The purpose(s) of the intended travel;\n• The specific dates of the trip; and\n• Travel destination(s).\nThe alien should include any supporting documentation they wish USCIS to consider in deciding their request in their statement.\nGenerally, the approval will not exceed six months. Advance permission to travel may be valid for one entry, or \nmultiple entries, depending on the stated purpose(s).\n(12) The alien does not fall under any of the categories above, but is applying for an Advance Parole Document based on guidance provided by DHS or USCIS. The alien will select “Other” on the application and provide \nproof of eligibility to apply for an Advance Parole Document based on DHS or USCIS guidance. The alien \nmust also include a statement describing:\n(a) The purpose(s) of the intended travel;\n(b) The specific dates of the trip; and\n(c) Travel destination(s).\nThe alien also should include any supporting documentation they wish USCIS to consider in deciding their request. \nImportant: If the alien has an application pending with USCIS and they leave the United States after obtaining an \nAdvance Parole Document, they may miss important notices from USCIS regarding their application, including \nrequests for additional evidence. If the alien does not respond timely to these notices, USCIS may deem their \napplication abandoned and, in that event, they will not receive the benefit they seek. It is very important that the alien \nmakes appropriate arrangements to ensure that they do not miss any such important notices.\nB. Travel Warning\nBefore an alien applies for an Advance Parole Document from inside the United States, they should read \nthe following travel warning carefully.\nRegardless of the basis for obtaining an Advance Parole Document:\n(1) Leaving the United States, even after obtaining an Advance Parole Document, may affect the alien’s ability to \nreturn to the United States;\n(2) If an alien presents an Advance Parole Document to DHS at a Port of Entry in the United States, the alien will be treated as an applicant for admission;\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 9 of 30\n(3) As an applicant for admission, the alien will be subject to inspection at a Port of Entry under INA  section 235 \nor any other provision of U.S. law. If DHS determines that the alien is inadmissible under INA section 212(a), \nthey may be subject to expedited removal proceedings or to removal proceedings before an immigration \njudge, as authorized by law and regulations;\n(4) The issuance of an Advance Parole Document does NOT entitle an alien to parole and does not guarantee that \nDHS will parole the alien into the United States upon their return;\n(5) As noted above, DHS will make a separate discretionary decision whether to parole the alien into the United \nStates each time they present an Advance Parole Document to DHS to request parole into the United States;\n(6) If, upon the alien’s return, they are paroled into the United States, they will remain an applicant for admission;\n(7) As noted above, DHS may revoke or terminate an Advance Parole Document at any time, including while \nan alien is outside the United States. Even if the alien had previously been paroled, upon their return to the \nUnited States, DHS may also revoke or terminate their parole in accordance with 8 CFR 212.5.\nIf the alien is outside the United States, revoking or terminating their Advance Parole Document may prevent \nthem from returning to the United States unless they have a valid visa or other document that allows them to \ntravel to the United States and seek admission; and\n(8) If an alien is paroled into the United States and DHS revokes or terminates their parole, they will be an unparoled applicant for admission, and may be subject to removal as an applicant for admission who is \ninadmissible under INA section 212(a), rather than as an alien in and admitted to the United States who is \ndeportable under INA section 237. In addition to the above, if the alien received deferred action under \nDACA, they should also be aware of the following:\n(a) Even after USCIS has deferred action in their case under DACA, if the alien travels outside the United \nStates without obtaining an Advance Parole Document, USCIS may terminate deferred action in their \ncase, in its discretion and following a Notice of Intent to Terminate with an opportunity to respond, and \ntheir ability to renew DACA may be adversely impacted;\n(b) If an alien obtains an Advance Parole Document in connection with a decision to defer removal in their case under DACA and if, upon their return, they are paroled into the United States, action on their case \nwill generally continue to be deferred. The deferral will continue until the date specified by USCIS or ICE \nin the deferral notice given to them or until the decision to defer removal action in their case has been \nterminated, whichever is earlier; and\n(c) If the alien has been ordered excluded, deported, or removed, and they are departing from the United States without having had their exclusion, deportation, or removal proceedings reopened and \nadministratively closed or terminated, departing the United States will result in their being considered \nexcluded, deported, or removed, even if USCIS or ICE has deferred action in their case under DACA and \nthey have been granted advance parole.\nC. Travel Warnings for CNMI Long Term-Residents\nIf the alien travels to Guam (not in direct transit between the CNMI and a foreign place) or elsewhere in the \nUnited States without advance permission, their status will be automatically terminated and they may be subject to removal from the United States. \nIf the alien travels to Guam (not in direct transit between the CNMI and a foreign place) or elsewhere in the \nUnited States in violation of any other restrictions regarding the dates, destination(s), or purpose(s) of their travel, \ntheir status will be automatically terminated and they may be subject to removal from the United States.\nD. If the alien is inside the United States and seeks an Advance Parole Document, we may not issue it to the \nalien if:\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 10 of 30\n(1) The alien holds or held a nonimmigrant status, such as J-1, that is subject to the 2-year foreign residence \nrequirement under INA section 212(e) as a result of that status. Exception: If the alien is subject to the 2-year \nforeign residence requirement, but is eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent \nresident because they obtained a waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement or they are no longer \nsubject to the requirement because they resided in their country of nationality for an aggregate period of \nat least 2 years after leaving the United States, we may consider their application for an Advance Parole \nDocument; or\n(2) The alien is in exclusion, deportation, removal, or rescission proceedings (that is, those proceedings are \npending or the alien is subject to an administratively final unexecuted order of exclusion, deportation, or \nremoval).

An invitation is not needed to apply for parole under this program. Beneficiaries may be required to provide biometrics, an interview , or medical \nexam results.\nNOTE: A derivative beneficiary can only receive benefits if the principal beneficiary receives benefits. A \nseparate application and fee for each individual principal and derivative beneficiary is required. Applications \nfor a principal beneficiary and any of his or her derivative beneficiaries must be submitted in one package \nwhen mailed to USCIS.\nAn individual may apply for parole on behalf of their family members under this program if:\n(a) The individual is living in the United States and is either a Filipino World War II veteran, as defined by \nsection 405 of IMMACT 90, as amended, or the surviving spouse of such individual;\n(b) The individual has filed Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, for a family member whose visa is not \nyet available (as indicated in the Application Final Action Dates chart in the Department of State’s Visa \nBulletin), and whose Form I-130 petition was approved on or before the date their request for parole \nunder the FWVP program is filed; and\n(c) The individual’s qualifying relationship with their family member existed on or before May 9, 2016.\nNOTE: If the individual is the surviving spouse of a Filipino World War II veteran, they may only apply for \nparole under the FWVP program on behalf of a child, son, or daughter who is also the child, son, or daughter of the Filipino World War II veteran.  They may apply for parole under the FWVP program on behalf of such \nindividuals, even if the approved Form I-130 on which they are beneficiaries had been filed by the deceased \nveteran, as long as that Form I-130 was reinstated by USCIS.\nNOTE: If the Filipino World War II veteran and his or her spouse are both deceased, certain beneficiaries of an \napproved Form I-130 that was automatically revoked and which USCIS reinstated, may apply for parole under this program on their own behalf.\nNOTE: Additional information regarding eligibility under the terms of the FWVP program is described under \n“Filipino WWII Veterans Parole Program” at www.uscis.gov/FWVP.\n\nForm I-131 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 11 of 30\n(2) Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative (IMMVI)\nCertain current and former military members and qualifying family members of the military member who are \noutside of the United States may be eligible to seek, on a case-by-case basis, a discretionary grant of parole in order to avail themselves of certain rights and protections afforded to current and former service members.

Although regulations generally require an LPR to travel with a valid Green Card, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) policy allows a transportation carrier bound for the United States to let you board without carrier documentation if you are:\nAn LPR with an expired Green Card that was issued with a 10-year expiration date, and you have been outside the United States for less than 1 year;\nAn LPR with an expired Green Card with a 2-year expiration date, and you also have Form I-797, Notice of Action, showing that you filed\nForm I-751, Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence\n, or\nForm I-829, Petition by Investor to Remove Conditions on Permanent Resident Status\n, and you have been outside the United States for less than 1 year.

      "instructions": "Instructions for Application for\n Carrier Documentation\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration ServicesUSCIS\n Form I-131A\nOMB No. 1615-0135\nExpires 02/28/2027Form I-131A Instructions  01/20/25   Page 1 of 7What Is the Purpose of Form I-131A?\nUnited States laws impose penalties on carriers (airlines, ships, etc.) that bring to the United States foreign nationals \nwho are not in possession of a valid passport and any required visa.  If you are a lawful permanent resident (LPR) or conditional permanent resident (conditional LPR) of the United States traveling overseas temporarily, you ordinarily may use your valid Permanent Resident Card (commonly called a Green Card) or a Reentry Permit (in place of a visa) as documentation of your eligibility to return to the United States.  If you do not have a valid, unexpired Permanent Resident Card or Reentry Permit (for example, your card or permit was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged), you may experience difficulties when you attempt to return to the United States.\nIf you are not an LPR or a conditional LPR, but you received a Form I-512/Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or \nForm I-766, Employment Authorization Document (EAD), with travel endorsement, and your document was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged while you are traveling overseas temporarily , you also may experience difficulties when you \nattempt to board your carrier and return to the United States.  \nThis application allows foreign nationals in these situations to apply for Carrier Documentation (Transportation Letter \nor Boarding Foil).  If the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that you remain an LPR or conditional LPR, or had previously received an Advance Parole Document on a Form I-512 or Form I-512L or travel endorsement on an Employment Authorization Document that is still valid, DHS may, as a matter of discretion on a case-by-case basis, provide a Carrier Documentation.  The Carrier Documentation may be a foil placed in your passport or a boarding letter.  If DHS provides Carrier Documentation, you may present the documentation to a carrier destined for the United States.  Generally, Carrier Documentation is valid for 30 days from the date of issuance.\nNOTE:  If your Advance Parole Document is a Boarding Foil issued by the Department of State and you are outside of \nthe United States, you should immediately report to the Department of State Consular Office where that foil was issued if your travel document containing that foil was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged.  You should not submit this application to replace a Boarding Foil.\nWarnings\n1. Carrier Documentation only allows you to demonstrate to the commercial carrier that you are not required to provide \na visa or comparable document at the time that you apply for admission or otherwise seek lawful entry into the United States at a U.S. Port-of-Entry (POE); it does not guarantee that you will be allowed into the United States.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will perform all the required inspection procedures, including determining admissibility or ability to enter, upon your arrival at a POE.\n2. DHS may revoke or terminate your Carrier Documentation at any time, with or without notice.  That revocation or termination could have implications for your travel.\nReplacing or Renewing Your Permanent Resident Card\nIf you no longer have your Permanent Resident Card, or it has expired, you must apply for a new Permanent Resident \nCard.  Receiving Carrier Documentation does not take the place of obtaining a new Permanent Resident Card.  To apply for a replacement of your Permanent Resident Card, you must file Form I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident \nCard, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  Visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/I-90 for more \ninformation.\n\nForm I-131A Instructions  01/20/25   Page 2 of 7\nReplacing Your Form I-512/I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766, EAD With Travel Endorsement \nIf you no longer have your Form I-512/I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766, Employment Authorization \nDocument, with travel endorsement and you choose to replace it after you return to the United States, you must file Form I-131 and/or Form I-765 with USCIS.  Receiving Carrier Documentation to facilitate travel back to the United States does not take the place of obtaining a new Form I-512/I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766, EAD with travel endorsement.  Visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/I-765 and www.uscis.gov/I-131 for more information.\nWho May File Form I-131A?\nYou may file Form I-131A to apply for Carrier Documentation if:\n1. You have been lawfully admitted to the United States as a LPR or conditional LPR;\n2. You have not lost LPR or conditional LPR status by abandoning that status or by removal from the United States; \n3. You have traveled abroad temporarily, and without any intent of abandoning your LPR or conditional LPR status;\n4. You wish to return to the United States using a valid Permanent Resident Card after an absence of less than 1 year or using a valid Reentry Permit after an absence of less than 2 years; and\n5. You are not in possession of a valid, unexpired Permanent Resident Card or Reentry Permit (for example, your card or permit was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged) or other document authorizing you to apply for admission to, or otherwise seek lawful entry into, the United States.\nYou also may file Form I-131A if:\n1. You received Form I-512/Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766,  Employment Authorization Document (with travel endorsement);\n2. The Form I-512/Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (with travel endorsement), has not been revoked;\n3. You wish to return to the United States after a temporary absence before your Form I-512/Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (with travel endorsement), expires; and\n4. You are not in possession of a valid, unexpired Form I-512/Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (with travel endorsement), because it was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged.\nWho is NOT eligible to receive Carrier Documentation?\nDHS retains the discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, to whom it is appropriate to provide Carrier \nDocumentation.  Some of the reasons that DHS may decline to provide you with Carrier Documentation are:\n1. You are physically present in the United States;\n2. You are no longer a valid LPR or conditional LPR of the United States; or\n3. You were issued Carrier Documentation and it is still valid, unless the prior documentation was returned to DHS or was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged; \n4. Your Form I-512/Form I-512L, Advance Parole Document, or Form I-766, Employment Authorization Document (with travel endorsement), has expired, will expire, or is revoked, before you return to the United States; or\nNOTE:  Form I-131A should not be used to apply for or replace Humanitarian Parole.  Please see the Instructions for Form I-131 if you seek to apply for Humanitarian Parole.\n\nForm I-131A Instructions  01/20/25   Page 3 of 7\n5. Your Advance Parole Document is a Boarding Foil issued by the Department of State and you are outside of the \nUnited States.  If your travel document containing that foil was lost, stolen, destroyed, or damaged, you should immediately report to the Department of State Consular Office where that foil was issued. \nExpired Permanent Resident Card\nIf you have an expired Permanent Resident Card (with a 10-year validity period) or Conditional Permanent Resident \nCard (with a 2-year validity period) and valid Form I-797, Notice of Action, for either Form I-751, Petition to Remove \nConditions on Residence, or Form I-829, Petition By Entrepreneur to Remove Conditions, showing you timely filed Form I-751 or I-829 (filed by or before the expiration date shown on the existing Conditional Permanent Resident Card).\nYou may use these documents to board a carrier to the United States, and you do not need to file Form I-131A.You should contact your carrier to confirm they will let you board with these documents; however, if they will not, you \nshould file Form I-131A.\nReturning Resident Visa\nAs an alternative to Form I-131A, it may be appropriate for you to obtain a returning resident (SB-1) visa as \ndocumentation of your LPR or conditional LPR status.  You may contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate (or visit its website), to obtain information about seeking a returning resident (SB-1) immigrant visa.  If you apply for and receive an SB-1 visa, you do not need to file Form I-131A.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

The individual who signs and files Form I-134 must establish that he or she has both sufficient financial resources and access to those funds to support the beneficiary listed \non Form I -134 for the duration of the beneficiary’s temporary stay in the United States. Beneficiaries are not obligated \nto repay, reimburse, or otherwise compensate their supporter in exchange for filing Form I-134 on their behalf or for providing financial support while they are in the United States.\nWho Must File Form I-134?\nCertain individuals applying for parole based on urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit filed on Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, must file this form with Form I-131. Form I-134 is filed either by the applicant for parole on his or her own behalf, or by another individual on the parole applicant’s behalf.\nNOTE: Whether or not the beneficiary of this Form I-134 will have sufficient means of support while in the United States \nis an important factor in determining whether to exercise discretion to authorize parole. We require evidence that the \nbeneficiary of this Form I-134 has financial support for the duration of his or her temporary stay in the United States. Lack of evidence of financial support while in the United States is a strong negative factor that may lead to a denial of parole.\nWho May File Form I-134?\nYou may file this form on behalf of yourself or on behalf of a B, F, or M nonimmigrant requesting extension of stay or change of status.  \nForm I-134 may also be requested by Department of State in certain instances.Do not use Form I-134 if the beneficiary you are agreeing to financially support must have Form I-864, Affidavit of \nSupport Under Section 213A of the INA, filed on his or her behalf instead.\nSubmission of Declaration\nIf you are agreeing to financially support more than one beneficiary , you must file a separate Form I-134 for each \nbeneficiary. You, as the individual agreeing to financially support the beneficiary, must sign your full name on the form.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

      "instructions": "Instructions for Application for Permission to \nRe-apply for Admission Into the United States \nAfter Deportation or Removal\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration ServicesUSCIS\n Form I-212\nOMB No. 1615-0018\nExpires 03/31/2027  \n  \n \n What Is the Purpose of Form I-212? \nIf you are inadmissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C), you must ask for \nconsent to reapply for admission to the United States (consent to reapply) before you can lawfully return to the United States. Consent to reapply is also called “permission to reapply.”  You should use this application to seek consent to reapply. \nWhy Do I Need Consent to Reapply? \nIf you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C), you need to obtain consent to reapply for admission to the United States under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii) or (C)(ii).  If you need to obtain consent to reapply, it is very important that you do not return to the United States before you have filed an application for consent to reapply , and before the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) has approved it. \nReturning unlawfully to the United States without inspection and admission or parole, or without obtaining consent to \nreapply for admission after having been excluded, deported, or removed, OR after having accrued, in the aggregate, more than one year of unlawful presence in the United States may make you permanently inadmissible to the United States under INA section 212(a)(9)(C). \nAdditionally, returning to the United States without obtaining consent to reapply when needed or returning unlawfully \n(such as returning without being inspected and admitted, or by fraud, or any other unlawful means after you have been excluded, deported, or removed) may have significant consequences, including: \n1. Reinstatement of your removal order under INA section 241(a)(5); \n2. Prosecution in criminal court under INA section 276; and \n3. A permanent bar from admission to the United States under INA section 212(a)(9)(C). \nReturning to the United States with a visa may not protect you from these consequences if you are required to obtain \nconsent to reapply, but did not get that consent.  \nThese Instructions contain more information about the grounds of inadmissibility and the consequences for failure to \nobtain consent to reapply in the Detailed Description of Grounds of Inadmissibility Under INA Sections 212(a)(9)(A) \nand (C), and Criminal Penalties Under INA Section 276 section of these Instructions. \nWho Should File This Application? \nYou should file this application if you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C).  To determine if one or both of these grounds of inadmissibility apply to you, read below in Detailed Descriptions of Grounds of \nInadmissibility Under INA Sections 212(a)(9)(A) and (C) and Criminal Penalties Under INA Section 276. \nPlease be aware that any departure from the United States may make you inadmissible under INA section \n212(a)(9)(A) or (C).  Traveling abroad with an Advance Parole Document is a departure for purposes of INA section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C).  \nForm I-212 Instructions 01/20/25 Page 1 of 17\n\nForm I-212 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 2 of 17 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n Inadmissibility Under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) \nYou will need to file Form I-212 if you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) because: \n1.

Before you have been outside the United States for a continuous period of: (1) 5 years, if you were removed as an arriving alien, but only once; \n(2) 10 years, if you were removed other than as an arriving alien, but only once; or \n(3) 20 years, if you were removed more than once, whether as an arriving alien or not. \nYou may file Form I-212 if you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A), but not INA section 212(a)(9)(C), and \nyou are: \n1. An applicant for an immigrant visa; \n2.

An applicant who wishes to seek admission as a nonimmigrant at a U.S. port-of-entry who is not required to obtain a nonimmigrant visa; or \nNOTE:  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has jurisdiction over these applications for consent to reapply.  \nFor more information on filing Form I-212 with CBP, consult the CBP website at www.cbp.gov. \n4. An applicant for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. Consulate. \nNOTE:  Some applicants who are applying for a nonimmigrant visa may not have to file Form I-212 to obtain consent \nto reapply for admission. The U.S. Consulate with jurisdiction over your nonimmigrant visa application will advise \nyou on whether and how to file to obtain consent to reapply for admission. \nInadmissibility Under INA section 212(a)(9)(C) \nYou will need to file Form I-212 if you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C) and you are: \n1. An applicant for an immigrant visa; \n2.

An applicant for a nonimmigrant visa at a U.S. Consulate. \nNOTE:  Some applicants who are applying for a nonimmigrant visa may not have to file Form I-212 to obtain consent \nto reapply for admission. The U.S. Consulate with jurisdiction over your nonimmigrant visa application will advise \nyou on whether and how to file to obtain consent to reapply for admission. \nEven if you are in one of the categories of applicants listed above, you may not file an application for consent to reapply \nif you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C) and:\n\nForm I-212 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 3 of 17 \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  1. You are in the United States; or \n2. You have not been physically outside the United States for more than 10 years since the date of your last departure \nfrom the United States. \nWho May Not Be Required to File For Consent to Reapply? \nIf any of the following apply to you, you may not be inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C), or both, and \nwould not need to seek consent to reapply for admission to the United States: \n1. You were inadmissible under INA 212(a)(9)(A), but your inadmissibility period has expired (see the Detailed \nDescriptions of Grounds of Inadmissibility Under INA Sections 212(a)(9)(A) and (C) and Criminal Penalties \nUnder INA Section 276 section of these Instructions to determine whether one or both of these grounds of inadmissibility apply to you); \n2. You were allowed to withdraw your application for admission at the border, and you departed from the United States within the time specified for your departure; \n3. You were refused entry at the border, but not formally removed; \n4. You were refused admission as an applicant under the Visa Waiver Program; \n5. You departed from the United States after having been unlawfully present for a year or more, in the aggregate, but you are not inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(1) because, when returning to the United States through a U.S. port-of-entry, you were paroled into the United States; \nNOTE:  Even if you were paroled when returning to the United States, after having been unlawfully present for a year \nor more, in the aggregate, you may still be inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(B).  You may be eligible under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(v) for a waiver of this ground of inadmissibility.  For more information on waivers, visit www.uscis.gov/forms and review the instructions for Form I-601 or Form I-601A. \n6. You were previously deported from the United States after having been ordered excluded, deported, or removed, but you are not inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) because, when returning to the United States through a U.S. port-of-entry, you were paroled into the United States; \nNOTE:  Even if you were paroled when returning to the United States after having left under an order of exclusion, \ndeportation, or removal, you may still be inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A), as discussed in the Who \nShould File This Application section of these Instructions. \n7. You received an order of voluntary departure from an immigration judge and left the United States during the time \nperiod specified in your voluntary departure order; \n8. You are an applicant for Registry under INA section 249; \n9. You are in U nonimmigrant status and you are applying for adjustment of status under 8 CFR 245.24; or \n10. You are an applicant for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under INA section 244.  \nNOTE: Although you may be inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C), USCIS cannot consider your \ninadmissibility under these provisions for purposes of a TPS application because INA section 244(a)(5) states that a \nTPS applicant’s current status may not be considered as part of the adjudication of TPS.  Therefore, TPS applicants do not need to file Form I-212 to establish eligibility for TPS.  Your inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C), however, may remain relevant and be considered for the purposes of other immigration benefits. \nApplicants for certain immigration benefits may be able to obtain a waiver of inadmissibility under INA  section 212(a) \n(9)(A) or (C) instead of consent to reapply for admission. See the Waiver of Inadmissibility Instead of Consent to \nReapply section of these Instructions.\n\nForm I-212 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 4 of 17 \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n Waiver of Inadmissibility Instead of Consent to Reapply \nSome applicants do not have to file Form I-212 to overcome their inadmissibility under INA  section 212(a)(9)(A) or (C).  \nIf you fall under one of the categories listed below, you may apply for a waiver of your grounds of inadmissibility by \nusing the following applications below. \n1. Use Form I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, if: A. You are an applicant for adjustment of status under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act \n(NACARA) section 202; \nB. You are an applicant for adjustment of status under the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act of 1998 (HRIFA) section 902; \nC. You are a T nonimmigrant applying for adjustment of status under 8 CFR 245.23; or \nD. You are an approved Violence Against Women Act (V AWA) self-petitioner seeking adjustment of status who is inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C).  \nNOTE:  If you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(A) and (C), you should file Form I-212 and Form I-601. \n2. Use Form I-690, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, under INA sections 245A or 210 if: \nA. You are an applicant for adjustment of status based on any legalization program under INA section 245A; or \nB. You are an applicant for adjustment of status based on any legalization program under INA section 210 (Special \nAgricultural Workers). \n3. Use Form I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as Nonimmigrant, if: \nA. You are an applicant for U nonimmigrant status.  You must file your Form I-192 with your Form I-918, Petition \nfor U Nonimmigrant Status. You do not need to file Form I-212 or a new waiver application if you are already in U nonimmigrant status and applying for adjustment of status under 8 CFR 245.24; \nB. You are an applicant for T nonimmigrant status.  You may file Form I-192 with your Form I-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status; or \nC. You are an applicant for nonimmigrant status and inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) for unlawful presence and subsequent reentry without admission or parole. You may be eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility authorizing you to enter as a nonimmigrant under INA section 212(d)(3)(A) at any time and as an alternative to consent to reapply, but only if you wish to seek admission to the United States as a nonimmigrant.  This authorization is temporary and does not eliminate the INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) ground of inadmissibility for immigrant purposes or future entries as a nonimmigrant. See the Instructions for Form I-192 to determine whether and how you may obtain a waiver of a ground of inadmissibility for authorization to enter as a nonimmigrant under INA section 212(d)(3)(A). \nWhen Should You Apply for Consent to Reapply? \nIf You Are Inadmissible Under INA Section 212(a)(9)(A) \n1. If you have already been excluded, deported, or removed from the United States and are currently outside the country, you must seek consent to reapply before returning to the United States.\n\nForm I-212 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 5 of 17 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  2. If you have been ordered removed, but have not left the United States, and will be applying for an immigrant visa \nabroad, you may file your application for consent to reapply before you leave the United States under the removal \norder.  If the agency, at its discretion, chooses to approve your application for consent to reapply, the approval is considered conditional until you actually depart the United States. Consent to reapply for admission in this situation applies only to inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(A).  You cannot file an application for consent to reapply for admission while you are in the United States if you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C).  \n3. If you are ordered removed again after approval of consent to reapply, you will have to file a new application for \nconsent to reapply.  A conditional approval does not protect you from any other ground of inadmissibility that may result from your departure from the United States, including under INA section 212(a)(9)(B).  See the Where To File \nsection of these Instructions to determine whether you qualify for the advanced, conditional approval. \nIf You Are Inadmissible Under INA Section 212(a)(9)(C) \n1. If you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i), you are permanently inadmissible and will always need \nto request for consent to reapply for admission BEFORE you return to the United States. \n2. You cannot file an application for consent to reapply until you have left the United States and have remained outside the country for at least 10 years since your last departure. After 10 years, you must request consent to reapply before you seek admission to the United States. \nDetailed Description of Grounds of Inadmissibility Under INA Sections 212(a)(9)(A) and (C) and Criminal Penalties Under INA Section 276 \nIf You Are Inadmissible Under INA Section 212(a)(9)(A)(i) \nYou must seek consent to reapply if you seek admission to the United States during the period specified in INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(i) and you are inadmissible because: \n1. You were removed from the United States as an inadmissible alien through expedited removal proceedings under INA \nsection 235(b)(1) that were initiated when you arrived at a U.S. port-of-entry; or \n2. You were removed from the United States as an inadmissible, arriving alien under INA section 240, and the removal proceedings were initiated when you arrived at a U.S. port-of-entry.  \nThe periods of time during which you must obtain consent to reapply for admission before you can apply for admission to the United States again are: \n1. 5 years from the date of removal, if you were only removed once; \n2. 20 years from the date of removal, if you were removed two or more times; or \n3. Forever, if you are an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony (as defined in INA  section 101(a)(43)).  \nYou must obtain consent to reapply for admission, even if you were not removed because of the aggravated felony \nconviction and even if you were convicted of the aggravated felony after you were removed from the United States. \nIf you seek admission to the United States before the appropriate inadmissibility period is over, you must file an \napplication for consent to reapply for admission to the United States. \nIf you do not know the provision of law that was the basis for your exclusion, deportation, or removal from the United States, review the official documents you received during your proceedings. These documents should indicate the section \nof law that applies to your case.\n\nForm I-212 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 6 of 17 \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n NOTE:  If you have remained outside the United States for the entire inadmissibility period, you are no longer required \nto seek consent to reapply.  Under INA section 276(a)(2)(B), you also will not be subject to criminal liability under \nINA section 276(a) if you return lawfully to the United States through a U.S. port-of-entry.  If you are granted consent to reapply for admission to the United States during the inadmissibility period, your inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(i) no longer applies. \nNOTE:  Even if the inadmissibility period under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(i) has already passed (you were required to \nremain abroad for 5 or 20 consecutive years, and have done so, and have not been convicted of an aggravated felony), you will become inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C) if you enter or attempt to enter the United States without being inspected and admitted or paroled. \nIf You Are Inadmissible Under INA Section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) \nYou must obtain consent to reapply if you seek admission to the United States during the period specified in INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) and you are inadmissible because: \n1. You were removed from the United States under INA section 240; \n2. You were ordered removed under any other provision of U.S. law; or \n3. You departed from the United States on your own while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal was \noutstanding (for example, you left after you were ordered removed, but before the U.S. Government could physically remove you based on your order of removal). This does not include a voluntary departure granted under INA section 240B if you departed the United States during the time period specified in your voluntary departure order . \nThe periods during which you must obtain consent to reapply before you can apply for admission to the United States again are: \n1. 10 years from the date of departure or removal, if you were only removed once; \n2. 20 years from the date of departure or removal, if you were removed two or more times; or \n3. Forever, if you were convicted of an aggravated felony (as defined in INA  section 101(a)(43)).  You must obtain \nconsent to reapply for admission, even if you were not removed because of the aggravated felony conviction and even \nif you were convicted of the aggravated felony after you were removed from the United States. \nNOTE:  If you have remained outside of the United States for the entire inadmissibility period, you are no longer \nrequired to file this application. Under INA section 276(a)(2)(B), you also will not be subject to criminal liability under INA section 276(a), if you return lawfully to the United States through a U.S. port-of-entry.  If you are granted consent to reapply for admission to the United States during the inadmissibility period, your inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) no longer applies. \nNOTE:  Even if the inadmissibility period under INA section 212(a)(9)(A)(ii) has already passed (you were required \nto remain abroad for 10 or 20 years, and have done so, and have not been convicted of an aggravated felony), you will become inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C) if you enter or attempt to enter the United States without being inspected and admitted or paroled. \nRemoval Under Any Provision of U.S. Law \nRemoval under any provision of U.S. law includes, but is not limited to: \n1. An exclusion and deportation order under INA section 236 as it existed prior to April 1, 1997; \n2. Arrest and deportation from the United States under any U.S. law prior to April 1, 1997; \n3. Removal under INA section 217 for a violation of terms of admission of the Visa Waiver Program;\n\nForm I-212 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 7 of 17 \n   \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n   \n \n 4. Removal under INA section 235(c) for security and related grounds; \n5. Removal as a stowaway under INA section 235(a)(2); \n6. Removal under INA section 238(b) after conviction of an aggravated felony; \n7. Removal after revocation of the crewmember’s landing permit under INA section 252(b); and \n8. Removal as an alien in distress under INA section 250. \nIf you do not know the provision of law that was the basis for your exclusion, deportation, or removal from the United \nStates, review the official documents you received during your proceedings. These documents should indicate the section \nof law that applies to your case. \nIf You Are Inadmissible Under INA Section 212(a)(9)(C) \nYou must seek consent to reapply if, on or after April 1, 1997, you entered or attempted to reenter the United States without being admitted or paroled after: \n1. You had been unlawfully present in the United States after April 1, 1997, for a total period of more than one year \n(INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I)); or \n2. You had been ordered removed from the United States under any provision of the INA or any other provision of law before, on, or after April 1, 1997 (INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(II)). \nIf you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i), you are permanently inadmissible and will always need to \nrequest consent to reapply for admission before you return to the United States. Also, each time you reenter or attempt \nto reenter the United States without admission or parole, you incur a new inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(C). You may not obtain consent to reapply for readmission unless you leave the United States and remain outside the country \nfor at least 10 years since your most recent departure. \nNOTE:  If you intend to seek admission to the United States as a nonimmigrant and are inadmissible under INA section \n212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) (unlawful presence for a total of more than one year , in the aggregate, and subsequent reentry without \nadmission or parole), you may be eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under INA section 212(d)(3)(A) instead of \nconsent to reapply for admission. This authorization is temporary and does not eliminate INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(I) ground of inadmissibility for future immigrant purposes. \nCriminal Penalties Under INA Section 276 \nYou may be subject to criminal prosecution and, if convicted, sentenced to prison under INA section 276, if you: \n1. Have been denied admission; \n2. Were excluded, deported, or removed from the United States; or \n3. Have departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding; \nAND then you: 1. Entered or attempted to enter the United States; or \n2. Are found in the United States unlawfully (including without consent to reapply for admission). \nYour return to the United States, even with a visa, is unlawful if you were required to obtain consent to reapply for \nadmission, but did not obtain that consent. \nEven if the period during which you are required to obtain consent to reapply has expired, you may still be subject to \ncriminal liability under INA section 276.  This could happen if you return to the United States unlawfully, without being inspected and admitted or paroled, or if you return by fraud or any other unlawful means.\n\nForm I-212 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 8 of 17 \n    \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  General Instructions \nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

However, if you are appealing a decision to revoke the approval of an immigrant petition under 8 CFR 205.2, you must file the appeal within 15 calendar days (or within 18 calendar days if we mailed the decision to you).\nNOTE:  If we sent you the decision by mail, the “date of service” is the date we mailed the decision, not the date you received it.

An appeal with the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO); or \n2. A motion with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office that issued the latest decision in your \ncase (including a field office, service center, or the AAO).  \nPlease visit  www.uscis.gov/i-290b/eligibility  for the immigration benefit types that are eligible for an appeal or motion \nusing this form.\nSchools may also use Form I-290B for appeals or motions regarding certain denials of Form I-17, Petition for Approval \nof School for Attendance by Nonimmigrant Student, filed with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), or when SEVP withdraws its approval for nonimmigrant students to attend the school.  The notice letter from SEVP will include instructions for filing an appeal and/or motion, if applicable.\nWho May Not File Form I-290B?\n1. If you are the beneficiary of a petition or application, you MAY NOT file an appeal or motion unless specifically \npermitted by law.  Beneficiaries of valid employment-based immigrant visa petitions who are eligible to change jobs or employers and who have properly requested to do so under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section \n204(j), 8 U.S.C. 1154(j) (called “porting”), are considered affected parties for revocation proceedings, including appeals and motions of revocations, relating to the immigrant visa petitions filed on their behalf.  USCIS must first make a favorable determination concerning the beneficiary’s porting eligibility in order for the beneficiary to be eligible to participate in the revocation proceeding as an affected party .\n2. Do not use this form to file an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).  The BIA has jurisdiction over \nappeals of Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, and Form I-360, Self-Petition for a Widow(er) of a U.S. Citizen.  You may file an appeal with the BIA using Form EOIR-29, which is available on our website at  www.uscis.gov/eoir-29 \nand at the Department of Justice website at www.justice.gov/eoir/list-downloadable-eoir-forms.\n3. Do not use this form to appeal a discretionary Adam Walsh “no risk” determination.  Regardless of the form type being appealed, you may not appeal a discretionary Adam Walsh Act (AWA) “no-risk” determination to either the BIA or the AAO.  Instead, you must file a motion with the office that issued the adverse discretionary determination in order to request an administrative review of that determination.\nHowever, the AAO does have jurisdiction in AWA cases to review determinations regarding general eligibility \nrequirements, including whether the required relationship has been established and whether an offense qualifies as a “specified offense against a minor.”\n4. Do not use this form for appeals of Special Agricultural Worker or Legalization applications.  You must file these appeals on Form I-694, Notice of Appeal of Decision Under Sections 245A or 210 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

For all other cases, you must file your appeal or \nmotion within 30 calendar days (or within 33 calendar days if we mailed the decision to you).\nNOTE:  If we sent you the decision by mail, the “date of service” is the date we mailed the decision, not the date you \nreceived it.  See 8 CFR 103.8(b).  Decisions are normally mailed the same day they are issued.\nUSCIS will reject a late appeal.  However, the office that issued the unfavorable decision may determine that the untimely \nappeal meets the requirements of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider and issue a separate decision.  \nUSCIS will dismiss a late motion.  However, we may excuse the failure to timely file a motion to reopen if you \ndemonstrate that the delay was both reasonable and beyond your control. \nSignature.  You (or your signing authority) must properly complete your form.  USCIS will not accept a stamped or \ntypewritten name in place of any signature on this form.  If you are under 14 years of age, your parent or legal guardian \nmay sign the form on your behalf.  A legal guardian may also sign for a mentally incompetent person.  If your form is not \nsigned, or if the signature is not valid, we will reject your form.  See 8 CFR 103.2(a)(7)(ii)(A).  If USCIS accepts a request \nfor adjudication and determines that it has a deficient signature, USCIS may deny the request.\nValidity of Signatures.  USCIS will consider a photocopied, faxed, or scanned copy of an original handwritten signature \nas valid for filing purposes.

Form I-356 can also be filed by the obligor (the person who posted the bond for the alien) or the obligor’s authorized agent (co-obligor, for surety companies only). \nThis request must be submitted according to the instructions provided in this request and the direct filing instructions \nposted on www.uscis.gov.\nNOTE:  This request does not have to be filed if a substitute bond is submitted to release an obligor from the current \nliability of a public charge bond posted with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on the alien’s behalf.  For more information about substitution of a public charge bond, please see Form I-945, Public Charge Bond, and its Instructions.  \nWhen Will USCIS Cancel a Public Charge Bond?\nA public charge bond will be cancelled once the alien dies, has permanently departed from the United States, is naturalized, or after the fifth anniversary of the alien becoming a lawful permanent resident (LPR).  See Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 213 and 8 CFR 103.6(c)(1).  A public charge bond may also be cancelled at any time if USCIS finds that the alien is not likely to become a public charge.\nRegardless of the reason cancellation of the public charge bond is requested, USCIS will only cancel the public charge \nbond if:\n1. The obligor (or agent/co-obligor) or the alien (or the alien’s attorney or accredited representative, if any, or if the alien is deceased, the executor of the alien’s estate) files this form to request cancellation of the public charge bond; \n2. The public charge bond was not breached.  A bond is breached when there has been a substantial violation of the stipulated conditions; and\n3. If requesting cancellation of the public charge bond after the fifth anniversary of becoming a lawful permanent resident, the requestor demonstrates that the alien did not become a public char ge prior to the fifth anniversary.\nWhen examining whether the public charge bond can be cancelled, USCIS evaluates whether there has been a breach of the bond and all requirements for cancellation are met.\nIf this request and the evidence does not establish that the bond can be cancelled, the bond will remain in effect until the \nconditions for cancellation of the bond are met.  USCIS will inform the obligor and the alien of the decision.  The obligor\n, \nbut not the alien (or the alien’s representative, if applicable), may appeal the decision in accordance with 8 CFR 103, Subpart A.\n\nForm I-356 Instructions   01/20/25             Page 2 of 7\nGeneral  Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

Use of Form I-407 also ensures that the individual abandoning LPR status is informed of the right to a hearing before an immigration judge and that the individual has knowingly , willingly , and affirmatively waived that right.\nWho May File Form I-407?\nForm I-407 is used by lawful permanent residents who are outside the United States or at a port of entry who want to abandon their LPR status.  Form I-407 may also be used by individuals who were admitted into the United States as nonimmigrants or paroled into the United States after abandoning a prior LPR status, and who now want to record that prior abandonment of LPR status.  Generally, if a parent abandons LPR status, any minor children in that parent’s custody will also have abandoned their LPR status.  If a parent, custodial parent, or legal guardian chooses to file a separate Form I-407 on behalf of a minor child, the parent, custodial parent, or legal guardian must submit evidence to establish the parental relationship to the minor child, custody of the minor child, or guardianship of the minor.\nForm I-407 is also used by U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and U.S. Department of State (DOS) \nconsular officers to record the facts relating to individuals who abandon LPR status during an in-person interview or by correspondence.\nGeneral Instructions\nFiling Fee.

If your answer to a question that requires a numeric response is zero or none (for example, “How many children do you have” or “How many times have you departed the United States”), type or print “None” unless otherwise directed.\n3. Provide your Alien Registration Number (A-Number) on the top right corner of each page.  Your A-Number is located on your Permanent Resident Card (formerly known as the Alien Registration Card).  The A-Number on your card consists of a seven- to nine- digit number, depending on when your record was created.  If the A-Number on your card has fewer than nine digits, place enough zeros before the first number to make a total of nine digits on Form I-407.  For example, type or print number A1234567 as A001234567 or type or print number A12345678 as A012345678.\n4. Your form must be properly completed, signed, and submitted.

Are or were a derivative beneficiary  (the principal beneficiary’s spouse or unmarried child under 21 years of age \nat the time the qualifying petition or application was filed) of an immigrant petition or application for permanent \nlabor certification that was properly filed on or before April 30, 2001, and which was approvable when filed; or\nC. Are currently the spouse or an unmarried child under 21 years of age who is eligible to accompany or follow-\nto-join a principal or derivative beneficiary described in Items A. or B. above, and the principal or derivative \nbeneficiary is currently applying for or was granted adjustment of status under INA  section 245(i).\nDocumentation. To prove the existence of a qualifying petition or application, submit an official document showing either:\n• The filing or approval of the immigrant petition (Form I-797, Notice of Action), which contains the principal \nbeneficiary’s name; or \n• The filing or approval of the permanent labor certification application (Form ET A-750), which contains the \nprincipal beneficiary’s name.\nIf you qualify to apply for adjustment of status under INA section 245(i) because you are or were a derivative beneficiary of a qualifying petition or application, you must prove the required relationship to the principal beneficiary by submitting a marriage certificate (for spouse) or birth certificate (for child). This evidence must show that the \nclaimed relationship existed at the time the qualifying petition or application was properly filed. You do not need to \nshow that the relationship still exists.\nIf you qualify to apply for adjustment of status under INA section 245(i) because you are the current spouse or an \nunmarried child under 21 years of age of a person who is or was the principal or derivative beneficiary of a qualifying petition or application, you must submit evidence of your current relationship to the principal applicant.\n2. The qualifying immigrant petition or application for permanent labor certification was properly filed.\nAn immigrant petition is considered properly filed if the:\nA. Petitioner properly signed the petition;\nB. Petitioner submitted the correct filing fee; and \nC. Petition was physically received at a designated USCIS office (then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)) on or before April 30, 2001, or was mailed with a postmark on or before April 30, 2001 (regardless of when INS received it).\nA permanent labor certification application is considered properly filed if the U.S. Department of Labor (or a \ndesignated state workforce agency) accepted the application on or before April 30, 2001, under applicable Federal \nregulations at the time.\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Supplement A Instructions   01/20/25 Page 5 of 9\nDocumentation. To show that your immigrant petition or permanent labor certification application was properly filed, \nyou must submit either: \n• Form I-797 showing a qualifying date of filing. (Form I-797 showing a filing date indicates the U.S. Government \naccepted the petition and implies that the U.S. Government determined the petition was signed and submitted with \nthe appropriate filing fee); or\n• Form ETA-750 bearing a state workforce agency’s date stamp, an agency letter, or other document specifying the date of receipt/filing.\n3. The qualifying petition or application was approvable when filed.\nAn immigrant petition or labor certification application is considered approvable when filed if:\nA. The petition or application was properly filed;\nB. The petition or application was meritorious in fact; and \nC. The petition or application was not frivolous (“frivolous” meaning patently without substance).\nDocumentation. Unless contradictory evidence exists, a final decision approving the required petition or application shows that the petition or application was approvable when filed. Such an approval consists of either:\n• An INS approval notice (on Form I-797) for the immigrant petition; or \n• A U.S. Department of Labor certification stamp (on Form ETA-750) for the permanent labor certification application.\nAbsent an approved petition or application, you may submit any relevant evidence to show the petition or application was properly filed and approvable when filed. USCIS makes this determination based on the circumstances that existed at the time the qualifying petition or application was filed. A\n  petition or application that was approvable when \nfiled but was later withdrawn, denied, or revoked due to circumstances that arose after the time of filing may still \nqualify you for INA section 245(i) adjustment if you are otherwise eligible.\n4. The principal beneficiary of the qualifying petition or application was physically present in the United States on \nDecember 21, 2000 (if applicable).\nIf you qualify to apply for adjustment of status under INA section 245(i) based on an immigrant petition or application \nfor permanent labor certification filed on or after January 15, 1998, you must prove that the principal beneficiary of that petition or application was physically present in the United States on December 21, 2000.\nDocumentation. In some cases, a single document may suffice to prove physical presence, but often you will need \nto submit several documents. USCIS will ordinarily place the greatest weight on government-issued documents. The \nfollowing list gives examples of documents that you may submit as evidence of physical presence:\n• Form I-94 Arrival-Departure Record, the nonimmigrant visa page of the principal beneficiary’s passport, Form \nI-512L, or other U.S. Government-issued document showing admission or parole into the United States after \ninspection by an immigration officer;\n• A Notice to Appear in Immigration Court;\n• Official correspondence or other notices from a U.S. Government agency;\n• A state driver’s license; \n• Income tax or property tax records, returns, or payments; \n• School or college transcripts and records; \n• Hospital or doctor’s records; \n• Lease agreements and rental receipts; \n• Utility bill receipts;\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n02/18/2025\nForm I-485 Supplement A Instructions   01/20/25 Page 6 of 9\n• Employment records, such as payroll statements or pay stubs; or\n• Bank and credit card statements and records. \nNOTE: If you submit a personal affidavit attesting to physical presence, you must also submit other supporting \ndocumentation. USCIS will evaluate all documentation on a case-by-case basis.\nIf you qualify to apply for adjustment of status under INA section 245(i) based on an immigrant petition or application \nfor permanent labor certification filed on or before January 14, 1998, you do NOT  need to submit any evidence of \nphysical presence.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

Portability means to change the offer of employment from one job or employer to another job or employer. The new job offer must be in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job offered to you in Form I-140 that is the basis of your Form I-485. \nNOTE: In adjudicating Supplement J, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not make a determination \nwhether you have current work authorization with the prospective employer . The basis for adjustment of status to \nlawful permanent resident under a valid Form I-140 is not actual (current) employment. Rather , the basis is prospective \nemployment. Therefore, the adjudication of Supplement J, for applicants requesting job portability under INA section \n204(j), is primarily limited to a determination of whether you have a valid job offer from a U.S. employer that is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the position for which the underlying Form I-140 was filed and approved. \nNOTE: Individuals seeking or granted a National Interest Waiver of the job offer requirement and individuals seeking or \ngranted classification as an alien of extraordinary ability under INA  section 203(b)(1)(A) do not need to file Supplement J. \nBecause these employment-based immigrant visa categories are not tied to a specific job offer , individuals seeking or \ngranted classification as an alien of extraordinary ability or seeking or granted a National Interest Waiver of the job offer \nrequirement do not have to file Supplement J when filing Form I-485 or to request job portability under INA section 204(j). \nWho May File Supplement J? \nUnless you are filing Form I-485 at the same time with a Form I-140 or while a Form I-140 is still pending that names you as the principal beneficiary, you must file Supplement J at the time you file your Form I-485 to confirm that the job offered \nto you in the underlying Form I-140 is still valid and available to you. Additionally, you must file Supplement J to request \njob portability if you are eligible. USCIS may request that you file Supplement J again prior to final processing of your \nForm I-485. \nTo request job portability to a new, permanent job offer under INA section 204(j), you must have a properly filed Form \nI-485 that: \n1. Has been pending with USCIS for 180 days or more since the receipt date; and \n2. Is based on an approved or pending Form I-140 that names you as the principal beneficiary .\n\nI-485 Supplement J Instructions  01/20/25 Page 2 of 7 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If the underlying Form I-140 is currently pending with USCIS and your Form I-485 has been pending with USCIS for 180 \ndays or more, you may still file Supplement J to request portability to a new , permanent job offer. However, please know \nthat USCIS must first adjudicate and approve the Form I-140 prior to approving your portability request, if otherwise eligible. \nWhen Should You File Supplement J? \nIf you are filing Supplement J to confirm that the job offer in the underlying Form I-140 is valid and still available to you, you must submit Supplement J when: \n•\t You initially file your employment-based Form I-485 with USCIS unless you are filing Form I-485 at the same \ntime as Form I-140 or while the Form I-140 is still pending, or if your Form I-485 was filed prior to January 17, \n2017; or \n•\t You have received a Request for Evidence (RFE) or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) from USCIS requesting confirmation that the job offer in the underlying Form I-140 is valid and still available to you or , if applicable, that \nthe job offer you have previously ported to under INA section 204(j) is valid and still available to you. \nNOTE: If Form I-140 is approved, USCIS may consider the approved Form I-140 and supporting documents, along with your filed Form I-485, as prima facie evidence that the job offer is valid and that you, the applicant, intend to accept the \njob offer if your Form I-485 is approved. However, depending on factors, such as the length of time it takes to adjudicate \nthe underlying Form I-140 and your filed Form I-485, USCIS may request that you submit Supplement J to confirm that \nthe job offer in the underlying Form I-140 is valid and still available to you prior to final processing of your Form I-485, \nor that you have ported to a new, permanent job offer under INA section 204(j). \nIf you are filing Supplement J to request job portability to a new, permanent job offer under INA section 204(j), \nyou may file Supplement J only after your Form I-485 was properly filed and has remained pending for 180 days or more since the receipt date, and: \n•\t You have received a new, permanent job offer from a U.S. employer that is in the same or similar occupational \nclassification as the job offered to you in the underlying Form I-140, and now you would like to request that the new job offer be used in connection with your eligibility to adjust status to that of lawful permanent resident; \n•\t You have received an RFE or a NOID from USCIS in connection with your pending Form I-485 asking for confirmation that the job offered to you in the underlying Form I-140 or a previously filed Supplement J is still available to you; or \n•\t You have received a NOID from USCIS regarding your Form I-485 because the petitioner has withdrawn the Form I-140 filed on your behalf, or the petitioner has gone out of business. \nIf you are requesting job portability under INA section 204(j), USCIS will reject Supplement J if you fle it before your Form I-485 has been pending for 180 days or more since the receipt date. Y ou can check your case status online at www.uscis.gov. \nWhat Evidence Must You Submit With Supplement J? \n1. If you are filing Supplement J to confirm that the job offer represented in the underlying Form I-140 is valid, then you, the applicant, only need to complete Parts 1., 2., 3., 4., and 5. of Supplement J and have the Form I-140 petitioner \ncomplete Parts 6., 7., 8., and 9. \n2. If you are filing Supplement J to request job portability under INA  section 204(j), you, the applicant, must complete \nParts 1., 2., 3., 4., and 5. and the employer offering a new permanent job must complete Parts 6., 7., 8., and 9.

A copy of Form I-797, Notice of Action, establishing the receipt date and acceptance of your Form I-485 under \nINA section 245, which shows that your Form I-485 has been pending for 180 days or more. If you do not have such documentation, USCIS will review the electronic record for the Form I-485 receipt number provided in Part 2. of Supplement J and/or any other USCIS records for evidence that you have filed a Form I-485 that has remained pending for 180 days or more; and \nB. If available, a copy of Form I-797 showing that you are the principal beneficiary of an approved or still pending Form I-140. If you do not have such documentation, USCIS will review the electronic record for the Form I-140 receipt number provided in Part 2. of Supplement J and/or any other USCIS records for evidence that you are the \nprincipal beneficiary of an approved or still pending Form I-140. \nNOTE: If you do not have the evidence listed in Items A. or B. above, you may provide information on Supplement J or \nother secondary evidence to demonstrate that you have filed Form I-485 which has been pending for 180 days or more since the receipt date, and that you are the principal beneficiary of an approved or still pending Form I-140. Failure to provide the evidence listed above or secondary evidence may result in delayed processing or denial of your request for job portability. \nNOTE: USCIS will review Supplement J in assessing whether the new job offer is in the same or a similar occupational \nclassification as the job in the underlying Form I-140. The applicant and/or employer may submit any other evidence that is relevant in showing the new job is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job specified in Form I-140. \nHow Does USCIS Determine What Qualifies as a Same or Similar Occupational Classification? \nTo determine whether the new job qualifies as the same or similar occupational classification as the job in the approved permanent labor certification (if applicable) and Form I-140, USCIS will review the totality of the record, including Supplement J and any additional evidence submitted by the applicant and/or employer . \nIn determining whether the new job is in the same or a similar occupational classification as the job specified in Form I-140, \nUSCIS will consider factors, including, but not limited to: \n•\t The similarity of the job duties and responsibilities; and/or \n•\t The similarity of the educational, experience, and/or training requirements. \nUSCIS may refer to resources published by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and its Bureau of Labor Statistics, or other relevant resources, to assist in determining whether the new offer of employment is in the same or similar occupational classification. These resources include: \n•\t DOL Occupational Outlook Handbook at www.bls.gov/ooh; \n•\t DOL O*NET system at www.onetonline.org; and \n•\t Standard Occupational Classification system used by DOL’s Occupational Employment Statistics program at www.bls.gov/soc. \nThese resources contain detailed information on job titles, duties, rates of pay , and educational, experience, and/or \ntraining requirements. In many cases, the resources do provide information on similar or related occupations. Applicants \nmay also use any of these resources or other relevant evidence to demonstrate that the new job is in the same or similar \noccupational classification as the job specified in Form I-140. \nUSCIS may request that you provide more information or evidence to support your Supplement J.\n\nI-485 Supplement J Instructions  01/20/25 Page 4 of 7 \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n General Instructions \nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

Form I-600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an \nImmediate Relative, is used for that purpose. \nWho May File Form I-600A? \nYou may file Form I-600A if you are a U.S. citizen who plans to adopt or has adopted a child from a country that is not party to the Hague Adoption Convention. You may file Form I-600A even if you do not have a specific child identified for adoption. \nWho May Not File Form I-600A? \nIf you seek to adopt a child who is habitually resident in a country that is a party to the Hague Adoption Convention, you cannot file Form I-600A and must instead use Form I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country. \nThere are exceptions. You may be able to file Form I-600A if: 1. You (and your spouse, if married) were not yet U.S. citizens when you adopted the child from a Hague Adoption \nConvention country, but the applicant is a U.S. citizen at the time of filing Form I-600A; or \n2. The child’s adoption is not governed by the Hague Adoption Convention. For example, the adoption took place before the Hague Adoption Convention entered into force for the child’s country of origin.

However, unless prohibited by the new Convention country, USCIS will permit prospective adoptive parent(s) to request an updated Form I-600A  approval notice to increase the number of \nchildren they are approved to adopt as a transition case only to pursue the adoption of a birth sibling, provided the birth sibling(s) is (are) identified and the Form I-600 petition is filed before the Form I-600A  approval expires. You may not use \nSupplement 3 to change to a transition country if you have already designated a country. See the adoption-related pages on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption for information on filing limitations in transition cases. \nInitial Evidence \nUnless otherwise stated, you must submit the following supporting documentation with your Form I-600A. \n1.

If you live in a state \nwhere an appropriate state authority must review, approve, and submit your home study directly to USCIS, it must be submitted within the same timeframe. If your home study is not received within one year, USCIS will deny your Form I-600A under 8 CFR parts 204.3(c)(2) and (h)(5). In all cases, your home study must not be more than six months old when it is submitted to USCIS. If it is more than six months old, you must include an update to the home study that is not more than six months old. \nYou must submit a home study prepared according to the requirements specified in 8 CFR 204.311 by a person who is \nauthorized under 22 CFR 96 to prepare the home study. \nA home study preparer is an individual or agency authorized to conduct home studies as a public domestic authority, \na public foreign authority, an accredited agency, approved person, supervised provider, or exempted provider (see 8 CFR 204.301).

This requirement does not apply to a home study that was conducted by a public domestic authority or a public foreign authority. A public domestic authority means an authority operated by a state, local, or tribal government within the United States. A public foreign authority means an authority operated by a national or subnational government of a foreign country. Although a reviewer is not required, a home study conducted by a public foreign authority or public domestic authority must still comply with the requirements specified in 8 CFR 204.311. \nHome Study Requirements \nFor a complete description of the requirements for a home study, see 8 CFR 204.311 and 22 CFR 96.

You may not use Form I-600A/I-600, Supplement 3. \n4. Change of residence, including a change in the child’s proposed residence. If you move to a new state in the United States, you must meet any pre-adoption requirements of that new state if a child is coming to the United States for adoption. \n5.

If your Form I-600A or Form I-600 combination filing is pending, submit your updated home study to the office reviewing your case; no Form I-600A/I-600 Supplement 3 is required. \nUSCIS will review your updated home study to determine your suitability and eligibility. \nDuty of Disclosure \nUnder 8 CFR 204.311(d), you, your spouse (if married), and any adult member of your household have an ongoing duty \nof disclosure throughout the intercountry adoption process.

Disclose other relevant information, such as physical, mental, or emotional health problems or behavioral issues; \n3. Disclose any arrest, conviction, or other criminal history, whether in the United States or abroad, even if the record \nof the arrest, conviction, or other criminal history was expunged, sealed, pardoned, or the subject of any other amelioration; \n4.

This timeframe \nincludes periods while any Form I-600A is pending, after any Form I-600A is approved, while any Form I-600 is pending, and until there is a final decision admitting the child to the United States with a visa. \nSee the adoption-related pages on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/adoption for information on duty of disclosure \nnotification periods. \nWARNING \nUnder 8 CFR 204.309(a), USCIS will deny this application if you, your spouse (if married), or any adult member of your \nhousehold: \n1. Conceal, misrepresent, or fail to disclose any facts to the home study preparer or USCIS about any arrest, conviction, \nor history of substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, and/or family violence, or any other criminal history as an offender. The fact that an arrest or conviction or other criminal history was expunged, sealed, pardoned, or the subject of any other amelioration does not relieve you, your spouse, or any additional adult member of your household of the obligation to disclose it;\n\nForm I-600A Instructions  01/20/25 Page 9 of 11 \n   \n \n \n 2. Fail to cooperate in having available child abuse registries checked in accordance with 8 CFR 204.31 1; \n3.

You \ndo not need to file this application if you are inadmissible under INA sections 212(a)(6)(A)(i) or 212(a)(9)(B)(i), as \nexplained in the NOTES below.\nIf you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(i):   USCIS has discretion to waive this ground of \ninadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(iii) for an approved V AWA self-petitioner and his or her child, if the self-\npetitioner can establish a “connection” between the battery or extreme cruelty that is the basis for the V AWA claim and the \nself-petitioner’s removal, departure from the United States, reentry or reentries into the United States, or attempted reentry \ninto the United States.\nIf you seek such a waiver, complete Form I-601 and attach evidence that shows the “connection” between the battery or \nextreme cruelty and your removal, departure from the United States, your reentry or reentries, or attempted reentry into \nthe United States.\nNOTE:   You do not need to file Form I-601 if you are an approved V AWA self-petitioner (or that person’s child) seeking \nadjustment of status and if you are inadmissible under INA section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) (presence in the United States without \nadmission or parole, or arrival in the United States, other than at an open U.S. Port-of-Entry.)  According to USCIS policy, \nyou are eligible for adjustment of status under INA section 245(a) regardless of your unlawful entry and USCIS also \nconsiders inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) waived for a beneficiary of an approved V AWA self-petition.  \nBecause inadmissibility under INA section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) ends when you leave the United States, you do not have to \nsubmit any special documentation with an immigrant visa application that is based on your approved V AWA self-petition.\nNOTE:  You do not need to file Form I-601 if you are an approved V AWA self-petitioner (or that person’s child) and \ninadmissible under INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i) (3-year or 10-year bar to admission).   You may be exempt from this \ninadmissibility if you, the approved V AWA self-petitioner or your child, can establish a substantial connection between the \nbattery or extreme cruelty that is the basis for your V AWA claim and the violation of your prior nonimmigrant admission.  \nYou must submit evidence of the substantial connection with your Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent \nResidence or Adjust Status, or your immigrant visa application.\nIf you cannot establish a substantial connection, but meet the requirements for the waiver of INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i), \nyou may file Form I-601.  The waiver may be granted if your qualifying U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident relative \n(spouse or parent) would experience extreme hardship if you were denied admission.\nFor information about how you can establish extreme hardship, see the What Evidence Must You Submit section of \nthese Instructions.\nYou Are an Applicant for Adjustment of Status Based on T Nonimmigrant Status\nIf you are an applicant for adjustment of status based on T nonimmigrant status, you may obtain a waiver of almost \nany ground of inadmissibility listed in INA section 212(a) that was not previously waived in connection with your T \nNonimmigrant Status.\nIf you are inadmissible based on health-related grounds (INA section 212(a)(1)), the waiver may be approved if granting \nthe waiver is in the national interest.\nIf you are inadmissible based on any other grounds, USCIS may grant the waiver if the activities making you inadmissible \nwere caused by or were incident to your trafficking victimization and granting the waiver is in the national interest.\nNo waiver of inadmissibility is available to adjustment of status applicants based on T nonimmigrant status for any of the \nfollowing grounds of inadmissibility:\n1. Security-related ground (INA section 212(a)(3));\n2. International child abductors (INA section 212(a)(10)(C)); or\n\nForm I-601 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 16 of 20\n3. Former citizens who renounced citizenship to avoid taxation (INA section 212(a)(10)(E)).\nNOTE:   You may not need to file Form I-601 if you are inadmissible only because you have been unlawfully present \nin the United States and then departed (INA section 212(a)(9)(B)).   You may be exempt from the 3-year or 10-year bar \nif you can establish that your victimization was at least one central reason for your unlawful presence in the United States.  \nYou should submit evidence with your Form I-485 to demonstrate that the victimization you suffered was a central reason \nfor your unlawful presence in the United States.\nYou Are an Applicant for Adjustment of Status as a Special Immigrant Juvenile\nIf you are applying for adjustment of status based on your approved Form I-360 classifying you as an SIJ, INA section \n245(h) contains waiver authority specific to you.\nSome grounds of inadmissibility do not apply to you.  You do not need to obtain a waiver if you are inadmissible based on:\n1. Public charge (INA section 212(a)(4));\n2. Labor certification (INA section 212(a)(5)(A));\n3. Aliens present without admission or parole (INA section 212(a)(6)(A));\n4. Immigration fraud or misrepresentation (INA section 212(a)(6)(C));\n5. Stowaways (INA section 212(a)(6)(D));\n6. Documentation requirements (INA section 212(a)(7)(A)); and\n7. Unlawful presence (INA section 212(a)(9)(B)).\nThe following grounds of inadmissibility cannot be waived under INA section 245(h):\n1. Conviction of certain crimes (INA section 212(a)(2)(A)) (except for a single offense of simple possession of 30 grams \nor less of marijuana);\n2. Multiple criminal convictions (INA section 212(a)(2)(B)) (except for a single offense of simple possession of 30 \ngrams or less of marijuana);\n3. Controlled substance traffickers (INA section 212(a)(2)(C)) (except for a single offense of simple possession of 30 \ngrams or less of marijuana);\n4. Security and related grounds (INA section 212(a)(3)(A));\n5. Terrorist activity (INA section 212(a)(3)(B));\n6. Foreign policy related (INA section 212(a)(3)(C)); and\n7. Participants in Nazi persecution, genocide, or the commission of any act of torture, or extrajudicial killing (INA  \nsection 212(a)(3)(E)).\nIf you are inadmissible under any other provisions of INA section 212(a), you must file Form I-601 with your adjustment \napplication.  Your inadmissibility may be waived if doing so is justified for humanitarian purposes, family unity, or for \nother reasons in the public interest.  You do not need to show extreme hardship for a waiver under INA section 245(h).  \nYou do not need a qualifying relative for a waiver under INA section 245(h).  The relationship to your natural parents or \nprior adoptive parents will not be considered a factor in making a decision on your waiver application.  Therefore, it is not \nnecessary for an SIJ to complete Part 5.  of the application.\n\nForm I-601 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 17 of 20\nWhat Evidence Must You Submit?\nIn support of your application, you should provide evidence that establishes why you may qualify for a waiver of \ninadmissibility.  In all cases, you must show that the approval of your application is warranted as a matter of discretion, \nwith the favorable factors outweighing the unfavorable factors in your case.  In Part 6., Item Number 9., include a \nstatement explaining why you believe your application should be approved as a matter of discretion, with the favorable \nfactors outweighing the unfavorable factors in your case.  If you include a separate letter that contains the statement \nexplaining why you believe your application should be approved as a matter of discretion, you must type or print into the space provided in Item Number 9. that you are attaching a letter.  The letter must be submitted at the same time as your \nForm I-601 application.\nNOTE:  If you are filing as an SIJ, and seeking a waiver under INA section 245(h), you may explain in Part 6., Item \nNumber 9., why your waiver should be granted for humanitarian purposes, family unity, or other reasons in the public \ninterest. \nDepending on the type of waiver you seek, this information and evidence may include, but is not limited to:\n1. Affidavits from you or other individuals;\n2. Police reports from any country you lived in;\n3. Complete court records about any conviction or charge from any country;\n4. If applicable, evidence of rehabilitation;\n5. Any evidence you may wish to submit to establish that your admission to the United States would not be against the \nnational welfare, public safety, or national security;\n6. Medical reports;\n7. If you are applying for a waiver from a ground of inadmissibility that requires a showing of extreme hardship and \nyou are the spouse, parent, son, or daughter of a U.S. citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, \nthe fiancé(e) of a U.S. citizen, or if you are a V AWA self-petitioner (or his or her child), you must submit evidence \nestablishing the family relationship (such as a birth certificate or marriage certificate, etc.) and include evidence that \nshows your denial of admission would result in extreme hardship to your qualifying relative (the U.S. citizen or \nlawful permanent resident spouse, parent, child, or your U.S. citizen fiancé(e)), or to yourself (or other qualifying \nindividuals) if you are a V AWA self-petitioner.  Pay close attention to the qualifying relationship that you have to \nestablish.  While the relationships appear to be similar, the various waiver provisions contain different qualifying \nfamily relationships.  The requirements that need to be established for each waiver are listed in Reasons for \nInadmissibility.  In Part 5., Item Number 9., include a statement explaining why your denial of admission would result in extreme hardship to your qualifying relative.  If you include a separate letter that contains the statement, \nyou must type or print into the space provided in Item Number 9. that you are attaching a letter.  The letter must be \nsubmitted at the same time as your Form I-601 application.\nFactors that USCIS considers when determining extreme hardship include, but are not limited to:\nA. Health.  For example:  Ongoing or specialized treatment required for a physical or mental condition, availability \nand quality of such treatment in the foreign country, anticipated duration of the treatment, chronic vs. acute or \nlong vs. short-term care, and need for the applicant to assist with any physical or mental conditions;\nB. Financial Consideration.  For example:  Future employability, loss due to sale of a home or business, \ntermination of a professional practice, decline in standard of living, ability to recoup short-term losses, cost of \nextraordinary needs such as special education or training for children with special needs, and cost of care for \nfamily members (elderly and sick parents);\nC. Education.  For example:  Loss of opportunity for higher education, lower quality or limited scope of education \noptions, disruption of current program, requirement to be educated in a foreign language or culture with ensuing \nloss of time or pay level, availability of special requirements, such as training programs or internships in specific \nfields;\n\nForm I-601 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 18 of 20\nD. Personal Considerations.  For example:  Close relatives in the United States and their country of birth or \ncitizenship, separation from spouse or children, ages of involved parties, length of residence and community ties in the United States; and\nE. Special Factors.   For Example:  Cultural, language, religious, and ethnic obstacles; valid fears of persecution, \nphysical harm, or injury; social ostracism or stigma; and lack of access to social institutions (official or unofficial) for support, guidance, or protection.\nEvidence of extreme hardship may include, but is not limited to:\nA. Affidavits from the qualifying relative or other individuals with personal knowledge of the claimed hardships;\nB. Expert opinions;\nC. Evidence of employment or business ties, such as payroll records or tax statements;\nD. Evidence of monthly expenditures such as a mortgage, rental agreement, bills and invoices;\nE. Other financial records supporting any claimed financial hardships;\nF. Medical documentation and/or evaluations by medical professionals supporting any claimed medical hardships;\nG. Records of membership in community organizations, volunteer confirmation, and evidence of cultural affiliations;\nH. Birth, marriage, or adoption certificates supporting any claimed family ties;\nI. Country-condition reports; and\nJ. Any other evidence you believe supports the claimed hardships.\n8. If you are a V AWA self-petitioner and you seek a waiver under INA section 212(a)(9)(C)(iii), submit any evidence that you believe establishes a connection between the battery or extreme cruelty that is the basis for the V AWA claim and your removal or departure from the United States, reentries or attempted reentry into the United States, and unlawful return or attempted unlawful return;\n9. If you are an applicant for adjustment based on your T nonimmigrant status and you seek a waiver under INA section 212(a)(1) or INA section 212(a)(4), submit any evidence that demonstrates it would be in the national interest to waive these grounds.  If you are seeking a waiver under any other INA  section 212(a) ground, submit evidence \nthat shows it would be in the national interest to waive that ground.  Also, you must demonstrate that the activities rendering you inadmissible were caused by or were related to your victimization; or\n10. If you are a TPS applicant, submit any evidence that demonstrates that granting your waiver would serve humanitarian purposes, family unity, or be in the public interest.\nNOTE:  Your application should be supported by documentary evidence, or you should explain in detail why you cannot obtain such evidence.  Mere assertions will not suffice.  Medical assertions should be supported by a medical professional’s statement.\nWhere To File?\nPlease see our website at www.uscis.gov/I-601 or call our USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283 for the most current \ninformation about where to file this application.

Have been selected by DOS to participate in the Diversity Visa (DV) Program (that is, you are a DV Program selectee) and are currently in the process of obtaining your immigrant visa; or\nC. Are the spouse or child of a principal beneficiary of an approved immigrant visa petition and have paid the immigrant visa processing fee to DOS, or you are the spouse or child of a DV Program selectee (that is, you are a  DV Program derivative), and you are currently in the process of obtaining your immigrant visa; and\nNOTE:  The Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) permits certain beneficiaries of immigrant visa petitions to retain \nclassification as a child even if they have reached 21 years of age.  Visit the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (USCIS) website at \nwww.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/child-status-\nprotection-act-cspa for more information.\nNOTE TO DV PROGRAM SELECTEES AND DERIV ATIVES:   Because a DV Program selectee or derivative \ncan only be issued a diversity immigrant visa during the fiscal year for which the DV Program selectee registered, \nyou can only obtain a provisional unlawful presence waiver while you are in the process of obtaining the immigrant visa with DOS.  You are in the process of obtaining an immigrant visa if the DOS Kentucky Consular Center (KCC) has assigned you a DV case number, and you are awaiting an immigrant visa interview while in the United States.\n4. Believe you are or will be inadmissible only for a period of unlawful presence in the United States that was:\nA. More than 180 days, but less than 1 year, during a single stay (INA section 212(a)(9)(B)(i)(I)); or\nB.

You do not meet all of the requirements listed in the Who May File Form I-601A  section of these Instructions;\n2. You have Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, pending with USCIS;\n3. You are in removal proceedings, unless your removal proceedings are administratively closed and have not been placed back on the Department of Justice (DOJ), Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) calendar to continue your removal proceedings at the time you file your Form I-601A;\nNOTE:  Even if your removal proceedings are administratively closed, you are still “in removal proceedings” until \nEOIR terminates or dismisses your case.  You are, however, eligible to apply for a provisional unlawful presence waiver if EOIR has not placed your removal proceedings back on its calendar to continue your removal proceedings.\n4. You are subject to an administratively final order of removal, exclusion, or deportation that has been entered or issued against you (including an in absentia order under INA section 240(b)(5)) unless, you applied for, and USCIS has already granted, an application for permission to reapply for admission under section 212(a)(9)(A)(iii) of the Act and 8 CFR 212;\nNOTE:  Permission to reapply for admission is also called “consent to reapply .”  The application is filed on Form \nI-212, \nApplication for Permission to Reapply for Admission into the United States After Deportation or Removal.  For \nmore information on Form I-212, please visit USCIS’ website at www.uscis.gov/I-212.\n5. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has entered a final decision reinstating a prior deportation, exclusion, \nor removal order against you under INA 241(a)(5) by serving you with a Form I-871, Notice of Intent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order, before you filed the provisional unlawful presence waiver application or while the provisional unlawful presence waiver application is pending;\nNOTE:  You are not yet ineligible for the provisional unlawful presence waiver if DHS has only served you with \na notice that DHS intends to reinstate a prior deportation, exclusion, or removal order, but only if DHS enters a final order reinstating the prior deportation, exclusion, or removal order .  You must still let USCIS know, if DHS \nhas served you with the notice that DHS intends to reinstate the order, since that fact may be material to the adjudication of your application.\n6. You are currently subject to an unexpired grant of voluntary departure from the immigration judge or the BIA; or\n7. You fail to establish that your U.S. citizen or LPR spouse or parent would experience extreme hardship if you are refused admission to the United States or that USCIS should approve your application as a matter of discretion.

You must also establish that your case warrants a favorable exercise of discretion by showing that favorable factors in your case should be given more weight than the unfavorable factors.\nCan I File Other Forms with Form I-601A?\nForm I-601A is a standalone application.  You cannot file Form I-601A with any other applications, petitions, or requests \nfor immigration benefits.  You also should not file any other applications, petitions, or requests for immigration benefits with Form I-601A or request that these applications, petitions, or requests for immigration benefits be co nsidered with \nForm I-601A.\nIf you submit your Form I-601A with any of the following forms, your application will be REJECTED and returned to \nyou with any fees paid:\n1. Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485);\n2. Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130);\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n02/24/2025\nForm I-601A Instructions   01/20/25   Page 3 of 20\n3. Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission Into the United States After Deportation or Removal (Form I-212);\n4. Application for Travel Document (Form I-131); or\n5. Application for Employment Authorization (Form I-765).\nNOTE:  You may file Form G-1145, E-Notification of Application/Petition Acceptance, with Form I-601A to request that \nUSCIS electronically notify you when USCIS accepts your Form I-601A application.\nNOTE:  Applicants for provisional unlawful presence waivers cannot seek adjustment of status in the United States \nbased on Form I-601A.  A provisional unlawful presence waiver is only effective if the applicant departs the United \nStates, attends the immigrant visa interview scheduled by DOS at a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate abroad, and the \nconsular officer finds that the applicant is eligible for the immigrant visa.  For more information about the immigrant visa process, visit the DOS website at www.state.gov.\nWhat Should I Do After I File Form I-601A?\nAfter you file your Form I-601A, it is important that you provide all required paperwork for your immigrant visa to the Department of State, National Visa Center (NVC).  The NVC cannot schedule your immigrant visa interview until it \nreceives all of your immigrant visa paperwork.  Failure to submit the required paperwork will delay your case.\nWhat Should I Do Once USCIS Approves My Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver?\n1. If you are in removal proceedings, resolve your removal proceedings.  If you are in removal proceedings and USCIS approves your Form I-601A, it is important that you resolve your removal proceedings before you leave \nthe United States.  Leaving the United States before your removal proceedings are resolved may delay processing \nof your immigrant visa based on another ground of inadmissibility.  Leaving the United States before your removal \nproceedings are resolved may also result in the automatic revocation of your approved provisional unlawful presence \nwaiver.  Visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/provisionalwaiver  for information about how to resolve your \nremoval proceedings before you depart the United States.\n2. Depart the United States to attend your immigrant visa interview.  You must depart the United States to attend your immigrant visa interview for the provisional unlawful presence waiver to become fully effective.  If you fail to \ndo this, your provisional unlawful presence waiver will not take effect and the approval may no longer be valid.\nHow Long Is My Approved Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver Valid and When Can USCIS             \nRevoke It?\n1. Validity of an approved waiver.  An approved provisional unlawful presence waiver takes effect once you depart \nthe United States, you appear for your immigrant visa interview, and the DOS consular officer determines you are \notherwise admissible to the United States and eligible for an immigrant visa.  Once your waiver takes effect, it is valid indefinitely for the period of unlawful presence that was waived.\n2. Revocation of an approved waiver.  An approved provisional unlawful presence waiver is automatically revoked and no longer valid if:\nA. You enter or attempt to reenter the United States without inspection and admission or parole:\n(1) While your application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver is pending with USCIS;\n(2) After your provisional unlawful presence waiver is approved; or\n(3) Before your immigrant visa is issued;\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n02/24/2025\nForm I-601A Instructions   01/20/25   Page 4 of 20\nB. The DOS consular officer determines at the immigrant visa interview that you are ineligible to receive the \nimmigrant visa because you are inadmissible on grounds other than the 3-year or 10-year unlawful presence bars;\nC. The immigrant visa petition that was the basis for the provisional unlawful presence waiver is at any time \nrevoked, withdrawn, or rendered invalid, but not otherwise reinstated for humanitarian reasons or converted to a \nwidow or widower petition (Form I-360);\nD. DOS terminates your immigrant visa registration in accordance with INA  section 203(g), and it has not been \nreinstated; or\nE. The DOS consular officer determines that you are ineligible for the immigrant visa.\nWhat Happens If My Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver is Denied or Revoked or If I Withdraw My \nPending Application?\nIf your provisional unlawful presence waiver is denied or is approved, but subsequently revoked, or you withdraw your \npending application:\n1. You may depart the United States to attend your immigrant visa interview and apply for a waiver abroad.  \nAt your immigrant visa interview at the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate abroad, DOS will make an admissibility \ndetermination.  If DOS determines you are inadmissible, based on unlawful presence or other grounds, you may file \nForm I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility, with USCIS from abroad, if a waiver is available to \nyou.\n2. You may file a new Form I-601A along with the required fees.  You must still meet all the eligibility requirements for the provisional unlawful presence waiver at the time of filing, including requirements to be physically present \nin the United States and to appear for your biometric services appointment at a USCIS Application Support Center \n(ASC).\n3. USCIS may initiate removal proceedings.  Denial of your provisional unlawful presence application does not automatically trigger initiation of removal proceedings.  USCIS will follow its current guidelines for \ninitiation of removal proceedings.  For more information on USCIS guidance for referral of cases and issuance \nof Notices to Appear (NTAs) in cases involving inadmissible and removable aliens, visit the USCIS website at                             \nwww.uscis.gov/provisionalwaiver .\nHow Does a Pending or Approved Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver Affect My Immigration          \nStatus?\nThe filing or approval of an application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver does not affect your current immigration status in the United States.  A pending or approved provisional unlawful presence waiver:\n1. Does NOT provide interim benefits.  Filing this application does not give you interim benefits such as employment authorization or eligibility to apply for advance parole to return to the United States.  A pending or approved waiver \nalso does not give you any interim benefits while your immigrant visa application is pending with DOS;\n2. Does NOT provide lawful status.  If you are not otherwise maintaining lawful status in the United States, the filing \nor approval of this waiver application alone does not give you lawful immigration status in the United States;\n3. Does NOT stop the accrual of unlawful presence or provide protection from removal.  A pending or approved \nwaiver will not prevent the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from initiating removal proceedings against \nyou or actually removing you from the United States.  A pending or approved waiver also does not protect you from accruing additional unlawful presence while still in the United States;\n\nDraft\nNot for \nReproduction\n02/24/2025\nForm I-601A Instructions   01/20/25   Page 5 of 20\n4. Does NOT remove the requirement to depart the United States and seek an immigrant visa.  If your provisional \nunlawful presence waiver is approved, you must still depart the United States to process your immigrant visa at a U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate abroad.  The approval of a provisional unlawful presence waiver does not make you \neligible for adjustment of status in the United States.  For more information on adjustment of status, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov/greencard;\n5. Does NOT guarantee immigrant visa issuance.  A DOS consular officer will determine if you are eligible for an immigrant visa.  There are many reasons why individuals are ineligible for an immigrant visa, and this provisional unlawful presence waiver only provisionally covers one ground of inadmissibility resulting from unlawful presence in the United States.  For more information about immigrant visa requirements, consult the DOS website at            http://nvc.state.gov; and\n6. Does NOT guarantee admission to the United States.  Having an approved waiver or immigrant visa does not guarantee your admission to the United States.  A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer will make a determination when you apply for admission at a U.S. Port-of-Entry.\nWhat Happens If I Depart the United States While My Form I-601A Is Pending or If I Enter or Attempt to Reenter Without Inspection and Admission or Parole?\nAll applicants for a provisional unlawful presence waiver must be in the United States at the time of filing Form I-601A  \nand appear for biometrics capture at a USCIS ASC.\nUSCIS may consider your case abandoned and deny it pursuant to 8 CFR 103.2(b)(13) if you do not appear for biometrics \ncapture, if you do not respond to a request for evidence (RFE), or if you do not appear for an interview when requested by USCIS.\nIf you depart the United States, and at any time before or after filing Form I-601A, enter or attempt to reenter the \nUnited States without inspection and admission or parole, you may be placed in removal proceedings, may be subject to additional grounds of inadmissibility that would render you ineligible for a provisional unlawful presence waiver, and any approval of Form I-601A would be automatically revoked.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

A foreign national seeking to come to the United States as a refugee (or derivative refugee because you are the spouse or child of a refugee); \n2. A foreign national in the United States seeking derivative refugee status (because you are the spouse or child of a refugee);\n3. A refugee already in the United States applying to become an LPR resident (green card holder); or\n4. An asylee in the United States and are now applying to become an LPR (green card holder).\nWho Should Not File Form I-602?\nDo not file this application if you are not seeking to be admitted to the United States as a refugee or are not a refugee or \nasylee applying to become an LPR (green card holder).  All other applicants for admission or adjustment of status to LPR \nwho are seeking a waiver of inadmissibility should consult the Form I-601 Instructions.\nIf you are inadmissible for any of following reasons, no waiver is available and you should not file this application:\n1. Controlled Substance Trafficker (Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 212(a)(2)(C));\n2. General Security and Related Grounds (INA section 212(a)(3)(A));\n3. Terrorist Activities (INA section 212(a)(3)(B));\n4. Adverse Foreign Policy Consequences for the United States (INA section 212(a)(3)(C)); and\n5.

Public charge (INA section 212(a)(4));\n2. Labor certification and qualifications for certain immigrants (INA  section 212(a)(5)); and\n3. Documentation requirements for immigrants (INA section 212(a)(7)(A)).\nIn addition, if you are seeking to come to the United States as a refugee (INA  section 207), the inadmissibility ground for \nvaccination requirements (INA section 212(a)(1)(ii)) does not apply and you do not need to file this application.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n03/05/2025\nForm I-602 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 2 of 9\nHow Long Is a Waiver Valid?\n1. If you are a seeking to come to the United States as a refugee:  If you are seeking to be admitted into the United \nStates as a refugee and USCIS grants your Form I-602, the inadmissibility ground will be waived when you enter the \nUnited States.  You will not need to apply for a waiver of this ground again if you apply for LPR status based on your \nrefugee status (adjustment of status under INA section 209).\n2. If you are a foreign national in the United States seeking derivative refugee status (because you are the spouse or child of a refugee):  If you are seeking derivative refugee status and USCIS grants your Form I-602, the inadmissibility ground will be waived.  You will not need to apply for a waiver of this ground again if you apply for \nLPR status based on your refugee status (adjustment of status under INA  section 209).\n3. If you are a refugee in the United States applying for LPR status:  If a ground of inadmissibility applied to you \nbefore you came to the United States and you did not obtain a waiver for it when you entered the United States as a \nrefugee, you can still apply for a waiver of that ground when you apply for LPR status (also known as getting a Green Card) based on your refugee status.\n4. If you become an LPR based on your refugee status after USCIS or an Immigration Judge grants a waiver of the grounds of inadmissibility, the grounds are permanently waived.  If you apply for immigration benefits in the future \nthat are subject to grounds of inadmissibility, you will not have to apply for a waiver again.\n5. If you apply for LPR status (also known as getting a Green Card) on any other immigrant category , you will have to \napply for a waiver of all grounds that apply to you, even those that were waived at the time you entered as a refugee.  The waiver that was granted to you as part of your entry into the United States would not be valid in this case.\n6. Asylees applying for LPR status:  If you apply for LPR status based on your asylee status in the United States (adjustment under INA section 209), you must file Form I-602 for all grounds of inadmissibility that apply to you.  If \nyou become an LPR based on your asylee status after USCIS or an Immigration Judge grants a waiver of the grounds \nof inadmissibility, the grounds are permanently waived.  If you apply for immigration benefits in the future that are \nsubject to grounds of inadmissibility, you will not have to apply for a waiver again.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

If \nthis Form I-602 is approved, the waiver that is granted applies only to the grounds of inadmissibility and those crimes, incidents, events, or conditions that you have included in your application.  For this reason, it is important to disclose all \nconduct or conditions that may cause you to be inadmissible, and list all grounds of inadmissibility for which you are \nseeking a waiver.\nYou Are Seeking a Waiver Under INA Section 207 or 209 for Health-Related Grounds of Inadmissibility Under INA \nSection 212(a)(1) \nYou must file this Form I-602 if you seek a waiver for any health-related ground of inadmissibility that is described below. USCIS, a DOS consular officer, or an immigration judge can determine your inadmissibility only based on the paperwork \nthat a physician completes after examining you.  The physician must be either a panel physician designated by DOS or a \ncivil surgeon designated by USCIS (including health departments which participate in USCIS’ blanket-designated civil \nsurgeon program for purposes of administering the vaccination requirements for refugees seeking adjustment of status).  The sections below outline what evidence you need to submit in addition to evidence showing that granting the waiver \nwould serve humanitarian purposes, family unity, or otherwise be in the public interest.\nThere are four health-related grounds of inadmissibility.\n1. Communicable Diseases of Public Health Significance  \nCommunicable Diseases of Public Health Significance are conditions that are defined by the Department of Health \n(HHS) and Human Services (in 42 CFR 34.2(b)) and include but are not limited to:  Class A  tuberculosis condition \n(as defined by HHS regulations), chancroid, gonorrhea, granuloma iguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum, syphilis \n(infectious stage), or leprosy (infectious also called Hansen’s disease).\nYou should submit a completed medical history and report addressing any possible treatment as part of your waiver \nrequest.\nIf you have a Class A Tuberculosis Condition (as defined by HHS regulations), you and the physician at the local \nhealth department in the area where you plan to reside must complete Part 4.\nComplete Part 3. if you have or had a physical or mental disorder and behavior associated with the disorder .\n2. You are Seeking a Waiver Under INA Section 209 of the Vaccination Requirement (This ground does not apply to \nforeign nationals seeking to come to the United States as refugees.)\nIf you are applying for lawful permanent resident status based on your refugee or asylee status, you must be \nvaccinated against vaccine preventable diseases, as determined by the Advisory Committee for Immunization \nPractices, HHS.  See INA section 212(a)(1)(A)(ii).  Currently, immigrants must be vaccinated against diseases such as, but not limited to, mumps, measles, rubella, polio, tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, pertussis, influenza type B, and other diseases.\nVaccinations protect the public health of the United States.  If you are unable to demonstrate that you have been \nvaccinated against all of the required vaccinations, and if you seek an exemption from the vaccination requirement because being vaccinated is against your religious beliefs or moral convictions, you may file a waiver .  \n You must \ndemonstrate that the waiver serves humanitarian purpose, preserves family unity , or is otherwise in the public interest.  \nTo meet this standard, you should also submit evidence that establishes that:\nA. You are opposed to vaccinations in any form;\nB. Your objection is based on religious beliefs or moral convictions; and\nC. Your belief or conviction is sincere.\n\nDraft\nNot for \nProduction\n03/05/2025\nForm I-602 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 6 of 9\n3. You are Seeking a Waiver Under INA Section 207 or 209 for Inadmissibility Due to Physical or Mental Disorder and \nAssociated Harmful Behavior\nYou must file this application if you seek a waiver of inadmissibility based on a physical or mental disorder with \nassociated harmful behavior.  Harmful behavior is behavior that poses, may pose, or has posed a threat to the \nproperty, safety, or welfare of you or others.  You also must submit this application if you seek a waiver to overcome \ninadmissibility based on a history of a physical or mental disorder with behavior associated with the disorder that has \nposed a threat to the property, safety, or welfare of you or others, and that is likely to recur or to lead to other harmful \nbehavior.\nIn addition to this application, you must submit a complete medical history and a report that addresses the following:\nA. Your physical or mental disorder and the behavior associated with the disorder that poses, has posed, or may pose \nin the future a threat to your property, safety, or welfare or the property, safety, or welfare of others.  The report \nshould also provide details of any hospitalization, institutional care, or any other treatment you may have received \nin connection with your disorder;\nB.

Who must submit Form I-693?\nMost applicants filing for adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident must submit Form I-693 \ncompleted by a designated civil surgeon.  Certain other applicants may also be required to submit Form I-693 completed by a civil surgeon.\n2. What if I am a refugee and already completed an immigration medical examination abroad?\nIf you are now applying for adjustment of status under INA section 209 one year after your first admission as a \nrefugee, then you only need to repeat the entire immigration medical examination if the panel physician found a Class A medical condition during your examination. \nIf the panel physician did not find a Class A medical condition and therefore, you do not need to repeat the full \nimmigration medical examination, then you must still comply with the vaccination requirements.  This means you only need to submit Part 10. Vaccination Record and Parts 1. - 5., and Part 7. of Form I-693.  Contact your state or \nlocal refugee health coordinator to find out whether a state or local health department can complete Part 10. of Form \nI-693.  The health department must also complete Part 7. of the benefit request.  \n3. What if I am a K nonimmigrant visa holder and already completed an immigration medical examination abroad?\nIf you were admitted as a:\nA. K-1 fiancé(e) or a K-2 child of a K-1 fiancé(e); or\nB. K-3 spouse of a U.S. citizen or a K-4 child of a K-3 spouse of a U.S. citizen; and\nC. You received a medical examination prior to admission, then:\n(1) You are not required to complete another immigration medical examination as long as you file your Form \nI-485 within one year of an immigration medical examination completed outside the United States; and\n(a) The panel physician did not find a Class A medical condition during your imigration medical examination; or\n\nForm I-693 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 8 of 12\n(b) The panel physician did find a Class A medical condition, you received a waiver of inadmissibility, and \nyou have complied with the terms and conditions of the waiver.\n(2) Even if a new immigration medical examination is not required, you must still show proof that you complied with the vaccination requirements.  If the vaccination record (DS 3025) was not properly completed and included as part of the original medical examination report completed abroad, you will need to have the Part \n10. Vaccination Record completed by a designated civil surgeon.  In this case, you must submit Parts 1. - 5., \n7., and 10. of Form I-693.\n4. What if I am an asylee derivative applying for adjustment of status and already completed an immigration \nmedical examination abroad? \nIf you were admitted to the United States as an asylee derivative, you generally do not need to repeat, at the time you \nsubmit Form I-485, the entire immigration medical examination provided that: \nA. The panel physician found no Class A medical condition during your immigration medical examination completed outside the United States; and \nB. You are applying for adjustment of status within one year of becoming eligible to file. \nYou must, however, comply with the vaccination requirement and submit Part 10. Vaccination Record  and Parts    \n1. - 5., and 7. of Form I-693 with your Form I-485.\n5. What if I am an Afghan national who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome (OAW), am applying for adjustment of status, and already completed an immigration medical examination abroad?\nIf you are an Afghan national applying for adjustment of status who entered the United States under OAW, you do not \nhave to repeat the immigration medical examination by submitting Form I-693 if:\n• The results of the immigration medical examination completed outside the United States by a panel physician are \nin your A-File and do not report a Class A medical condition;\n• The panel physician completed the immigration medical examination no more than 4 years before the date you \nfile to adjust status; and\n• No evidence suggests that you have acquired a Class A medical condition after entry into the United States.\n6. May any doctor perform the required immigration medical examination?\nOnly a doctor who was designated by USCIS as a civil surgeon may perform the medical examination (except for \nlimited exceptions for military and health department blanket designated civil surgeons).  USCIS will not accept a \nForm I-693 completed by a doctor who is not a currently designated civil surgeon.\n7. How do I know if a doctor is a designated civil surgeon?\nDoctors found through the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov or through the USCIS Contact Center are generally \ncurrent in their designation as civil surgeons.  Applicants who are unsure should ask doctors to confirm their status as \na civil surgeon.\n8. Who pays for the immigration medical examination?\nYou, the applicant, must pay all costs of the immigration medical examination, including the cost of any follow-up \ntests or treatment that is required.  Make payments directly to the civil surgeon or other health care provider.\n9. What are the health-related grounds of inadmissibility?\nU.S. immigration law divides the health-related grounds of inadmissibility into the following four general categories:\nA. Communicable diseases of public health significance;\nB. Lack of proof of having received required vaccinations;\nC. Physical or mental disorders with associated harmful behavior or a history of associated harmful behavior; and\n\nForm I-693 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 9 of 12\nD. Drug abuse or addiction.\nSee INA section 212(a)(1)(A).  HHS regulations classify these and other medical conditions into class A or B \nmedical conditions.  Class A medical conditions result in inadmissibility while Class B medical conditions do not.                 See 42 CFR 34.2(d) - (e).\nMedical Evaluations\n1. Communicable Diseases of Public Health Significance\nThe civil surgeon is required to perform specific tests for tuberculosis, syphilis, and gonorrhea.  The medical \nexamination also requires the civil surgeon to evaluate for other sexually transmitted diseases and Hansen’s disease (leprosy).\nIf you have a communicable disease of public health significance, the civil sur geon will advise you on how to obtain \ntreatment.  USCIS will inform you of whether you also need to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility.  To learn more \nabout this waiver, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov.\nA. Testing for Tuberculosis\nAll applicants two years of age and older must be tested for tuberculosis (TB) with an initial \nscreening test.  Civil surgeons may require an applicant younger than two years of age to undergo testing if there is evidence of contact with a person known to have TB or other reasons to suspect TB.  Testing must be completed per CDC guidelines, which can be found on the CDC website at                                                                                                           www.cdc.gov/immigrant-refugee-health/hcp/civil-surgeons/tuberculosis.html.  If that test is positive, the applicant is required to have a chest X-ray and if that is abnormal and suggestive of TB, the applicant must be referred to the health department.\nB. Testing for Syphilis (See CDC’s Syphilis Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons for required testing ages.)\nCivil surgeons must consult the latest version of CDC’s Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons                  \n(www.cdc.gov/immigrant-refugee-health/hcp/civil-surgeons/syphilis.html ) to ensure they are testing the \ncurrently required age ranges, using an approved type of test and following appropriate screening and testing procedures.  Civil surgeons may require testing for applicants outside the CDC specified age ranges if there is reason to suspect infection with syphilis.\nC. Testing for Gonorrhea (See CDC’s Gonorrhea Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons for required testing ages.)\nCivil surgeons must consult the latest version of CDC’s Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons                  \n(www.cdc.gov/immigrant-refugee-health/hcp/civil-surgeons/gonorrhea.html ) to ensure they are testing the \ncurrently required age ranges, using an approved type of test, and following appropriate screening and testing procedures.  Civil surgeons may require testing for applicants outside the CDC specified age ranges if there is reason to suspect infection with gonorrhea. \n2. Physical or Mental Disorders\nThis category of physical or mental disorders includes any diagnosis of substance-use disorders that involve any \nsubstance that is not listed in Schedule I, II, III, IV , or V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (for example, diagnosis of an alcohol-use disorder).  Mental disorders are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) or by another authoritative source as determined by the CDC director.  Physical disorders are diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria in the most recent edition of the World Health Organization’s Manual of the International Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD) or by another authoritative source as determined by the CDC director.  See the CDC’s Technical Instructions for Civil Surgeons for more information.\n\nForm I-693 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 10 of 12\nThe presence of a physical or mental disorder alone does not make you inadmissible on health-related grounds.   \nThe civil surgeon must also determine that there is behavior associated with the disorder that is harmful to you, to \nothers, or to property.  USCIS will only consider you inadmissible if there is a current associated harmful behavior or a history of associated harmful behavior that is likely to recur.\nThe civil surgeon will ask you general questions during the medical examination to determine whether you have such \na condition.  The civil surgeon may refer you to a specialist for further evaluation, if necessary.\nIf the civil surgeon finds that you have a physical or mental disorder with associated harmful behavior, you may apply \nfor a waiver.  If the waiver is granted, you may be subject to terms, conditions, and controls as determined by USCIS in consultation with HHS.  For more information about these waivers, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov.\n3. Drug Addiction and Drug Abuse\nHHS sets the medical guidelines for determining drug abuse and drug addiction.  The terms are defined at             \n42 CFR 34.2(h) and (i).  The civil surgeon will review your medical history during the medical examination and ask \nyou questions necessary to determine whether you are currently using any drugs or other psychoactive substances or have used them in the past.\n“Drug abuse or drug addiction” is “current substance use disorder, mild, moderate, severe” but only with respect \nto substances listed in Schedule I, II, III, IV , or V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act.  The diagnosis is \nmade according to the diagnostic criteria in the most current edition of the DSM or by another authoritative source as determined by the CDC Director.\nIf the civil surgeon determines you have a substance-related disorder, you are not eligible to apply for a waiver unless \nyou are applying for adjustment of status one year after you were admitted as a refugee or granted asylum.You will no longer be inadmissible based on drug abuse or drug addiction if, after a later medical examination by \na civil surgeon, the civil surgeon finds your drug abuse or addiction is in remission.  The diagnosis of remission is made according to the diagnostic criteria in the most current edition of the DSM or another authoritative source as determined by the CDC director.\nVaccination Requirements\nAll applicants for adjustment of status must present documents showing they were vaccinated against a broad range of vaccine-preventable diseases.  The civil surgeon will review your vaccination history with you to determine whether you have had all the required vaccinations.  Make sure you take your vaccination records with you to your appointment with the civil surgeon.\nNOTE:  With the exception of those required to get the COVID-19 vaccine, you should not attempt to meet the \nvaccination requirements before the civil surgeon evaluates you in case any of the required vaccines are not medically appropriate for you.  However, completing the COVID-19 vaccination process before your appointment with a civil surgeon will expedite the immigration medical examination process.  For more information about the COVID-19 vaccination requirements, see www.cdc.gov/immigrant-refugee-health/hcp/civil-surgeons/vaccination.html .\nYou can find information about other required vaccines at          \nwww.cdc.gov/immigrant-refugee-health/hcp/civil-surgeons/vaccination.html .\nIf you never received certain vaccines, or you are unable to prove you received them, the civil surgeon can provide them to you.  You also have the option to ask your family doctor to administer those vaccines to you after your evaluation by the civil surgeon.  If you choose that option, show the records to the civil surgeon to note on Form I-693.\nIf you initially did not have documents proving you received all the required vaccines, but later submit those documents, \nUSCIS may grant you a waiver based on the civil surgeon’s certification on Part 10. Vaccination Record of Form I-693.  \nUSCIS may also grant you a blanket waiver if the civil surgeon indicates that you may be eligible for blanket waivers for some vaccines but have otherwise completed all other medically appropriate and available vaccination requirements.\n\nForm I-693 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 11 of 12\nHHS has determined that a vaccine is “not medically appropriate” if:\n1. The vaccine is not recommended for your specific age group;\n2. There is a medical reason why it would not be safe to have the vaccine (for example, you are allergic to eggs and/or \nyeast or you had bad reactions to prior vaccines);\n3. You are unable to complete the entire series of a required vaccine within a reasonable amount of time;\n4. For the influenza vaccine, it is not available in the location where the civil sur geon practices; or\n5. For the COVID-19 vaccine, it is not routinely available in the location where the civil surgeon practices.\nIf you object to required vaccinations because of sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions, you may apply for a waiver of these requirements.  If you hold these objections, inform the civil surgeon that you will apply for a waiver.  If USCIS denies the waiver application, we may also deny the immigration benefit that you are seeking.  For more information about these waivers, visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov.\nAddress Change (For Applicants Only)\nAn applicant or petitioner who is not a U.S. citizen must notify USCIS of his or her new address within 10 days of moving \nfrom his or her previous residence.  For information on filing a change of address, go to the USCIS website at   \nwww.uscis.gov/addresschange or reach out to the USCIS Contact Center at www.uscis.gov/contactcenter for help.

Through our digital self-help tools and live assistance, the USCIS Contact Center provides a \npathway for you to get consistent, accurate information and answers to immigration case questions.\nPenalties\nIf you (the applicant or the civil surgeon) knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal a material fact or submit a false document with the Form I-693, we will deny your Form I-485 and may deny any other immigration benefit.  In addition, you will face severe penalties provided by law and may be subject to criminal prosecution.\nDHS Privacy Notice\nAUTHORITIES:   The information requested on this form, and the associated evidence, is collected under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act section 212(a)(1)(a).\n\nForm I-693 Instructions   01/20/25 Page 12 of 12\nPURPOSE:  The primary purpose for providing the requested information on this form is to report results of a medical \nexamination and provide vaccination records to USCIS.

If you need more space to complete an answer, \nuse a separate sheet of paper. Write your name and USCIS Account Number, if known, at the top of each sheet of paper and indicate the part and number of the item to which the answer refers.\nWhat Is the Purpose of This Form?\nThe Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Convention) entered into force with respect to the United States on April 1, 2008. The Convention strengthens protections for children, birth parents, and prospective adoptive parent(s), and establishes internationally agreed upon rules and procedures for adoptions between countries that have a treaty relationship under the Convention (Convention countries). It ultimately provides a framework for member countries to work together to ensure that children are provided with permanent, loving homes; that adoptions take place in the best interests of a child; and that the abduction, sale, or traffic in children is prevented.\nA Convention country is defined as a country that is a party to the Convention and with which the Convention is in force \nwith respect to the United States. To obtain a current listing of Convention countries, visit the U.S. Department of State website at www.travel.state.gov. Additional information on intercountry adoptions can be found on the USCIS Internet \nwebsite at www.uscis.gov.\nUse Form I-800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative, to finalize the immigration process if you will adopt a child who habitually resides in a Convention country and you have an approved, valid Form I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country. Form I-800 and supporting evidence are required for USCIS to determine the child’s eligibility for classification as a Convention adoptee.\nWhen Should I Use Form I-800?\nYou should use Form I-800 when:\n1. You have an approved, valid Form I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country; and\n2.  The Central Authority in the selected Convention country has proposed placing a child for adoption with you and your spouse (if applicable).\nNOTE: Central Authority means the entity designated as such by a Convention country under Article 6(1) of the Convention. In the United States, the U.S. Department of State is the Central Authority. Central Authority also means an individual who, or entity that, is performing a Central Authority function, having been authorized to do so by the designate Central Authority, in accordance with the Convention and the law of the Central Authority’s country.\nAs provided in 8 CFR Part 204.301 and in these instructions, the term “Central Authority” includes the actual Central \nAuthority of a Convention country and also any other individual or entity that is authorized to carry out a Central Authority function by delegation.\nForm I-800 must be filed before the expiration of the notice of the approval or extension of Form I-800A  and before the \nchild’s 16th birthday\n\nForm I-800 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 2 of 1 1\nInstructions for a Child Between Age 15 and 16 \nThere are two instances requiring special instructions relating to children between the ages of 15 and 16.\n1. If the Central Authority in the selected Convention country places the child with you for adoption more than 6 months \nafter the child’s 15th birthday but before the child’s 16th birthday, you must still file Form I-800 before the child’s 16th birthday. However, if the required evidence is not yet available, you may submit a statement from the primary adoption service provider, signed under penalty of perjury under U.S. law, confirming that the Central Authority has, in fact, made the adoption placement on the date specified in the statement. The primary adoption service provider in \nyour case is the accredited or temporarily accredited agency, or approved person who is responsible under 22 CFR Part 96.14 for the six adoption services defined in 22 CFR Part 96.2, and for supervising and being responsible for \nsupervised providers where used.\nSubmission of Form I-800 with this statement will satisfy the statutory requirement that the petition must be submitted \nbefore the child’s 16th birthday. Note that no provisional or final approval of Form I-800 will be granted until the required evidence has been submitted.\nWhen submitted, the required evidence must show that the Central Authority did, in fact, make the adoption \nplacement decision before the child’s 16th birthday.\n2.

However, you must include a statement from your primary provider, signed under penalty \nof perjury under U.S. law, confirming that the Central Authority has, in fact, made the adoption placement on \nthe date specified in the statement. Submission of your Form I-800 with this statement will satisfy the statutory \nrequirement that the petition must be submitted before the child’ s 16th birthday, but no provisional or final \napproval of your Form I-800 will be granted until after you have submitted the Article 16 report.

Specific information about \nmedical inadmissibility can be found in section 212(a)(1) of the INA and in regulations adopted by the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and published in 42 CFR Part 34.\nA formal decision concerning whether the child whom you seek to adopt is medically inadmissible under section \n212(a)(1) of the Act will only be made after a designated panel physician (for visa cases) or civil surgeon (for \nadjustment of status cases) has completed the required medical examination of the child. If the medical information \nthat is already available to you indicates that the child whom you intend to adopt may be inadmissible under section \n212(a)(1) of the Act, you should file Form I-601 with Form I-800. If you do not file Form I-601 with Form I-800, you \ncan still file Form I-601 later, if it is determined that your child is inadmissible.\nWhere To File?\nPlease see our website at www.uscis.gov/I-800  for the most current information about where to file this petition.\nAddress Change\nIf you are not a U.S. citizen, you must notify USCIS of your new address within 10 days of moving from your previous \nresidence.

      "instructions": "Application for Determination of Suitability to \nAdopt a Child from a Convention Country \nDepartment of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Ser vicesUSCIS\n Form I-800AForm I-800A Instructions   01/20/25  Page 1 of 13Instructions\nRead these instructions carefully to properly complete this form. If you need more space to complete an answer, \nuse a separate sheet of paper. Write your name and USCIS Account Number, if known, at the top of each sheet of paper and indicate the part and number of the item to which the answer refers.\nWhat Is the Purpose of This Form?\nThe Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Convention) entered into force with respect to the United States on April 1, 2008. The Convention strengthens protections for children, birth parents, and prospective adoptive parent(s), and establishes internationally agreed upon rules and procedures for adoptions between countries that have a treaty relationship under the Convention (Convention countries). It ultimately provides a framework for member countries to work together to ensure that children are provided with permanent, loving homes, that adoptions take place in the best interests of a child, and that the abduction, sale, or traffic in children is prevented.\nA Convention country is defined as a country that is a party to the Convention and with which the Convention is in force \nwith respect to the United States. To obtain a current listing of Convention countries, visit the U.S. Department of State website at www.travel.state.gov. Additional information on intercountry adoptions can be found on the USCIS Internet \nwebsite at www.uscis.gov.\nUse Form I-800A, Application for Determination of Suitability to Adopt a Child from a Convention Country, to initiate the immigration process if you intend to adopt a child who habitually resides in a Convention country. Form I-800A and supporting evidence are required for USCIS to determine your eligibility and suitability to adopt a Convention child.\nWhen Should I Use Form I-800A?\nYou should use Form I-800A if you are a U.S. citizen who habitually resides in the United States and you intend to adopt a child who is a habitual resident of a Convention country. See “Who May File This Form I-800A?” of these instructions for more information on who may submit this application.\nNOTE: Do not use this form if you intend to adopt a child from a country other than a Convention country. See the \ninstructions provided on Form I-600A, Application for Advance Processing of Orphan Petition, and Form I-600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative, for additional information.\nIf you filed Form I-600A and/or Form I-600 prior to April 1, 2008, and you intend to adopt a child from a Convention \ncountry, you may continue to have your case processed according to governing regulations for eligibility as an orphan. Do \nnot use Form I-800A if you wish to continue your case under the provisions of existing orphan regulations.\nCAUTION:\nDo not accept any adoption placement before USCIS has approved Form I-800A. You must also refrain from any contact \nwith the parent(s), legal custodian(s), or other individual or entity responsible for the care of a child who may be eligible for intercountry adoption until the contact is permissible under Article 29 of the Convention.\n\nForm I-800A Instructions   01/20/25 Page 2 of 13\nOnce the Central Authority of the child’s Convention country has proposed an adoption placement, and you have accepted \nit, you must file Form I-800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative, before you adopt or \nobtain custody of the child. You may not file Form I-800 until the Form I-800A has been approved.\nDo not adopt or obtain custody of the child until after :\n1. USCIS has approved Form I-800A;  and\n2. You have obtained provisional approval of Form I-800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate \nRelative;  and\n3. The U.S. Department of State has provided to the Central Authority of the child’s country of origin the notice, under \nArticle 5 of the Convention, that the adoption or custody proceeding may be completed.\nNOTE:  Central Authority means the entity designated as such by a Convention country under Article 6(1) of the \nConvention. In the United States, the U.S. Department of State is the Central Authority. Central Authority also means an \nindividual who, or entity that, is performing a Central Authority function, having been authorized to do so by the designate \nCentral Authority, in accordance with the Convention and the law of the Central Authority’s country. \nWho May File Form I-800A?\nYou may file this application if you are a U.S. citizen who habitually resides in the United States. You are a habitual \nresident of the United States if:\n1. You are domiciled in the United States; or\n2. You are domiciled in the United States, even if temporarily living outside the United States; or\n3. You are not currently domiciled in the United States, but you will establish a domicile in the United States on or \nbefore the date of the child’s admission to the United States for permanent residence as a Convention adoptee; or\n4. You are domiciled abroad, but you intend, after you complete the child’s adoption abroad, to bring the child to the \nUnited States before the child’s 18th birthday, so that the child may obtain naturalization as a U.S. citizen.\nAnd:\n5. You are unmarried and at least 24 years of age; or\n6. You are married and you and your spouse will both adopt a child based on the approval of Form I-800A; and\n7. If you are married, your spouse is either a U.S. citizen, a non-citizen U.S. national, or an alien who, if living in the \nUnited States, holds a lawful status under U.S. immigration law. If your spouse is not a U.S. citizen or national and is \nin the United States in a lawful status other than the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, such \nstatus will be a factor in determining whether your family situation is sufficiently stable to support a finding that you \nand your spouse are suitable as the adoptive parents of a child from a Convention country.\nWho May Not File Form I-800A?\nYou may not file Form I-800A if:\n1. You and your spouse are a married couple but neither of you is a U.S. citizen;\n2. You are an unmarried individual who is not a U.S. citizen;\n3.

If your spouse (if married) is not a resident of the United States, proof of his or her name, identity, and citizenship. An \nexample of such proof is a copy of his or her passport from the country of citizenship.\n5. Proof of marital status (if applicable). If you are married, you must submit a copy of the marriage certificate and proof \nof termination of all prior marriages of you and your spouse. If you are now unmarried but were previously married, \nsubmit proof of termination of all prior marriages. Examples of such proof include:\nA. Divorce decree;\nB.

Evidence of compliance with preadoption requirements, if any. If the State of the child’s proposed residence has \nany preadoption requirements, these requirements must be complied with if the Convention adoptee is coming to be \nadopted in the United States. A qualified Convention adoptee is deemed to be coming to be adopted in the United \nStates if either of the following factors exists:\nA. The applicant/petitioner will not complete the child’s adoption abroad; or\nB. In the case of a married applicant/petitioner, the child was adopted abroad only by one of the spouses, rather \nthan by the spouses jointly, so that it will be necessary for the other spouse to adopt the child after the child’s \nadmission.\n7. Home Study.  The home study must be prepared by an authorized home study preparer. The home study preparer (or, \nif the home study is prepared by an entity, the officer or employee who has authority to sign the home study for the \nentity) must personally sign the home study and any updated or amended home study under penalty of perjury under \nU.S. law.\nA home study preparer is an individual or agency authorized to conduct home studies for Convention adoption cases, \neither as a public domestic authority, an accredited agency, a temporarily accredited agency, approved person, supervised \nprovider, or exempted provider. The home study preparer (other than a public domestic authority) must hold any license or \nother authorization that may be required to conduct adoption home studies under the law of the jurisdiction in which the \nhome study is prepared. You should specifically ask any adoption service provider whether they are authorized to provide \nadoption services in connection with Convention adoptions according to 22 CFR Part 96 before engaging the services that \nprovider.\n\nForm I-800A Instructions   01/20/25  Page 9 of 13\nNOTE: An accredited agency or temporarily accredited agency must review and approve any home study that has \nnot been performed by an accredited agency or temporarily accredited agency before it is submitted to USCIS. This requirement does not apply to a home study that was actually prepared by a public domestic authority. A public domestic \nauthority means an authority operated by a State, local, or tribal government within the United States.\nThe home study must be submitted with your application. The only exception to this requirement is if you live where \nan appropriate State authority must review and approve a home study before it is submitted to USCIS. In such a case, do not file Form I-800A until that appropriate State authority has reviewed your home study and is ready to submit it to USCIS.\nIf your Form I-800A is submitted without the home study because your State of residence must review and forward the \nhome study directly to USCIS, indicate that fact on your application (Part 4., Item Number 1).\nIf you submit your application without a home study because you indicate that it will be forwarded to USCIS directly by the State authority, USCIS will send you a notice providing you with the date by which the home study must be submitted. If the State authority fails to submit the home study by the date specified, USCIS may deny your Form I-800A. Thus, you \nor the accredited agency will need to work closely with your State authority to ensure that the home study is submitted on time.\nIn all cases, the home study must not be more than 6 months old when submitted to USCIS. If it is more than 6 months old \nwhen submitted, you must include an update or amendment that is not more than 6 months old.\nHome Study Requirements\nFor a complete description of the requirements that a home study must meet, see 8 CFR Part 204 311 and 22 CFR Part 96.\nNOTE: You can find information on immigration laws, regulations, and procedures by visiting our Internet website at \nwww.uscis.gov.\nHome study updates and amendments\nOrdinarily, a home study will not have to be updated or amended after it has been submitted to USCIS unless there is \na significant change in your household since the home study was completed. Listed below are examples of significant \nchanges that require a home study amendment or update. Note that the list of changes below is not exhaustive. Your \nadoption service provider can advise you regarding other changes which may require an amended or updated home study.\nA. Change in marital status. An approved Form I-800A will be revoked automatically if you are an unmarried \nprospective adoptive parent who marries, or if your current marriage ends. Revocation of the approval of Form I-800A \nwill be without prejudice to the filing of a new Form I-800A.\nIf the change in marital status is:\n1. While your application is pending, you must submit an updated or amended home study with a new Form I-800A, \nthat reflects your changed marital status and required signature(s). \n2. After your application has been approved, a new Form I-800A, which reflects your new marital status, will be \nrequired, along with an updated and amended home study. \nA. Change of residence including change in the child’s proposed State of residence. The preadoption \nrequirements, if any, of any new State of residence must be complied with in the case of a child coming to the \nUnited States to be adopted.\nB. Any change in history of arrest, child abuse, substance abuse, or domestic violence  for you, your spouse (if \nmarried), or any household member regardless of age.\nC. Change to different Convention country. This change requires the updated home study to address suitability \nunder the requirements of the new Convention country.\n\nForm I-800A Instructions   01/20/25  Page 10 of 13\nD. If, prior to the Convention child’s immigration to the United States, there is an addition of one or more \nchildren to your home, whether through adoption, foster care, birth, or any other means, an amended home study is required. This requirement must be met even if the original home study recommended the adoption of more than one Convention child. The amended home study must recommend the adoption of an additional child, because the actual placement of one or more child(ren) in your household after the home study was completed, is a significant change in the household which must be assessed before the adoption of any additional child(ren).\nE. The addition of other dependents or adult member(s) of the household to the family prior to the prospective child’s immigration to the United States.\nF. Change because you are seeking to adopt a handicapped or special needs child, if the home study did not already address your suitability as the adoptive parent of a child with the particular handicap or special need.\nG. A lapse of more than 6 months  between the date the home study is completed and the date it is submitted to \nUSCIS.\nH. Change in the number of children or characteristics  (such as age and/or sex) of the child(ren) you intend to \nadopt.\nFiling updates and amendments to the home study\nThe location for filing an update to your home study and the items you must include will depend on where you are in the \nadoption process.\nYou must submit a Form I-800A Supplement 3 with your updated home study unless your Form I-800A is pending. \nIf your Form I-800A is pending, submit your updated home study to the office reviewing your case; no Form I-800A Supplement 3 is required. \nUSCIS will review your updated home study to determine your suitability and eligibility. \nIf it becomes necessary to file an updated or amended home study, it must always be accompanied by a copy of the home \nstudy that is being updated or amended, including all prior updates and amendments.\nIf submission of an updated or amended home study becomes necessary after USCIS has approved Form I-800A, you \nmust file Form I-800A, Supplement 3.\nIf USCIS determines that the amended or updated home study shows that you and your spouse (if married) remain suitable \nadoptive parent(s) for a Convention adoptee, a new approval notice will be issued which will have the same expiration date as the original approval, unless the amended home study was submitted in support of a request for extension of approval.\nDuty of Disclosure:\nUnder 8 CFR Part 204. 311(d), you, your spouse, and any adult member of your household have a duty of candor \nin completing Form I-800A and home study process. This duty requires you, your spouse, and any member of your household, to:\n1. Provide true and complete information to the home study preparer; and\n2. Disclose other relevant information, such as physical, mental, or emotional health problems; and\n3. Disclose any arrest, conviction, or other adverse criminal history, whether in the United States or abroad, even if the \nrecord of the arrest, conviction, or other adverse criminal history has been expunged, sealed, pardoned, or the subject of any other amelioration ; and\n4. Disclose any history of substance abuse, sexual abuse or child abuse, and/or family violence as an offender; and\n5. Notify the home study preparer and USCIS of any new event or information that might warrant submission of an amended or updated home study.\n\nForm I-800A Instructions   01/20/25  Page 1 1 of 13\nWith respect to child abuse or neglect, this duty of disclosure requires the disclosure of any currently pending \ninvestigation by any child welfare agency, court, or other official authority in any State or foreign country concerning the abuse or neglect of any child, as well as past investigation other than  an investigation that has been completed and \nformally closed based on a finding that the allegation of abuse or neglect was unfounded or unsubstantiated.\nThis duty of disclosure is an ongoing duty, and continues while your Form I-800A is pending, after Form I-800A is \napproved, and also while any Form I-800 that you may file is pending and until there is a final decision admitting a child, on whose behalf you filed Form I-800, to the United States with a visa.\nWARNING:\nUnder 8 CFR Part 204.309(a), this application will be denied if you, your spouse, or any adult member of the \nhousehold:\nA. Fail to disclose to the home study preparer or to USCIS, or conceal, or misrepresent, any fact(s) about any arrest, conviction, or history of substance abuse, sexual abuse, child abuse, and/or family violence, or any other criminal history as an offender. The fact that an arrest or conviction or other criminal history has been expunged, sealed, \npardoned, or the subject of any other amelioration does not relieve you, your spouse, or any additional adult \nmember of the household of the obligation to disclose the arrest, conviction, or other criminal history;\nB. Fail to cooperate in having available child abuse registries checked in accordance with 8 CFR Part 204.311;\nC. Fail to disclose, as required by 8 CFR Part 204.311, each and every prior adoption home study, whether completed or \nnot, including those that did not favorably recommend you, your spouse, or any adult member of the household for \nadoption or custodial care.\nAs part of the USCIS biometrics services requirement, the following persons must submit biometrics (including \nfingerprints) in connection with this application:\nA. You and your spouse (if married); and\nB. Each additional member of your household who is 18 years of age or older, or any person whose presence in the \nresidence is relevant to the issue of your (and your spouse, if applicable) suitability to adopt, as determined by USCIS.\nNOTE: After submission of Form I-800A, USCIS will notify each person regarding when and where to go to submit biometrics.

Filing during this window reduces the risk that your current period of DACA and employment authorization will expire before you receive a decision on your renewal request. Please note that filing earlier than 150 days before your current DACA expiration date will not result in a faster decision. For additional information on DACA, including the requirements for renewal, please visit\nuscis.gov/DACA\n.\nAlert Type info\nALERT: Important Update on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\nOn Jan. 17, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\nissued a decision\nregarding the DACA Final Rule. Pursuant to the court’s order, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23. USCIS will continue to accept initial requests but will not process initial DACA requests at this time. Current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated.\nAlert Type info\nALERT: Court decisions regarding DACA.\nOn Sept. 13, 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas issued a decision finding the\nDACA Final Rule\nunlawful and expanding the original July 16, 2021, injunction and order of vacatur to cover the Final Rule. However, the court maintained a partial stay of the order for “all DACA recipients who received their initial DACA status prior to July 16, 2021.” See the\nMemorandum and Order\nand\nSupplemental Order of Injunction\n.\nAccordingly, current grants of DACA and related Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) remain valid until they expire, unless individually terminated.  In accordance with this decision, USCIS will continue to accept and process DACA renewal requests and accompanying applications for employment authorization under the DACA regulations at 8 CFR 236.22 and 236.23, as it has since October 31, 2022. We will also continue to accept initial DACA requests, but in accordance with the District Court’s order, we will not process initial DACA requests.\nCurrent valid grants of DACA and related EADs will continue to be recognized as valid under the Final Rule. This means that individuals with DACA and related EADs do not have to submit a request for DACA or employment authorization until the appropriate time to seek renewal.\nPlease see the\nDACA Litigation Information Page\nfor important updates and information related to court rulings on the DACA policy.\nUse this form to request that we consider a renewal of your deferred action status on a case-by-case basis.\nDeferred action is an act of prosecutorial discretion to defer removal of an individual. Individuals who receive deferred action will not be removed from the United States for a specified period of time, unless the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chooses to terminate the grant of deferred action.

USCIS considers \ndeferring action (including Renewal of deferred action) on a case-by-case basis, based on the guidelines in the What \nis a Childhood Arrival for Purposes of This Form section of these instructions. Deferred action is a discretionary determination to defer removal of an individual as an act of prosecutorial discretion. Individuals who receive deferred \naction will not be placed into removal proceedings or removed from the United States for a specified period of time, unless the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chooses to terminate the deferral. See 8 CFR Part 236, Subpart C; \nsee also www.uscis.gov/DACA . \nWhen Should I Use Form I-821D? \nUse this form to request consideration of Initial DACA or Renewal of DACA.

S. Attorney needing the information or testimony of that alien). Forms I-854A and I-854B assist DOS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in their joint responsibility to adjudicate requests by LEAs for S classification and adjustment of status under INA section 245(j).\nWho Should Use These Forms?\nFederal, state, or local LEAs (the U.S. Attorney’s Office is considered an LEA for purposes of this form) may use these forms to request that an alien witness and/or informant is:     \n1.\n    Classified as an S nonimmigrant (Form I-854A); or  \n2.    Allowed to adjust to lawful permanent resident status from the S nonimmigrant classification (Form I-854B).\nThe LEA must specifically request the following for the alien witness and/or informant and his or her derivatives.\n1.

By signing Form I-864, you are agreeing to use your resources to support the intending immigrants named in this affidavit, if it becomes necessary. \nThe submission of this affidavit may make the sponsored immigrant ineligible for certain Federal, state, or local means-\ntested public benefits, because an agency that provides means-tested public benefits will consider your resources and assets as available to the sponsored immigrant when determining his or her eligibility for the program. \nIf the immigrant sponsored in this affidavit does receive one of the designated Federal, state or local means-tested public \nbenefits, the agency providing the benefit may request that you repay the cost of those benefits. That agency can sue you \nif the cost of the benefits provided is not repaid. \nNot all benefits are considered as means-tested public benefits.

You must provide either an Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) transcript or a photocopy from your own records of your Federal individual income tax return for the most recent tax year, counting from the date of signing Form I-864.  If you believe additional returns may help you to establish your ability to maintain sufficient income, you may submit transcripts or photocopies of your Federal individual income tax returns for the three most recent years. \nYou are not required to have the IRS certify the transcript or photocopy unless specifically instructed to do so by a \nGovernment official; a plain transcript or photocopy is acceptable. \nDo not submit copies of your state income tax returns. Do not submit any tax returns that you filed with any foreign \ngovernment unless you claim that you were not required to file a Federal individual income tax return with the United \nStates Government and you wish to rely on the foreign return solely to establish the amount of your income that is not subject to tax in the United States. \nIf you provide a photocopy of your Federal individual income tax returns, you must include a copy of each and every \nForm W-2 and Form 1099 that relates to your returns.  Do not include copies of these forms if you provide an IRS transcript of your Federal individual income tax returns rather than a photocopy unless you filed a joint income tax return with your spouse and are qualifying using only your income. \nIf you selected Part 6., Item Number 2. that you are self-employed, you should have completed one of the following \nforms with your Federal income tax return: Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business), Schedule D (Capital Gains), \nSchedule E (Supplemental Income or Loss), or Schedule F (Profit or Loss from Farming). You must include each and \nevery Form 1040 Schedule, if any, that you filed with your Federal income tax return. \nAs stated previously, you must submit an IRS transcript or copy of your Federal individual income tax return for the \nmost recent tax year.  If you choose to rely on income from the three most recent tax years, you must submit an IRS transcript or copy of your Federal individual income tax return. If you were required to file a Federal income tax return \nfor that tax year but did not do so, you must file all late returns with the IRS and attach an IRS transcript or copy of your late return and submit it with Form I-864. If you were not required to file a Federal income tax return under U.S. tax law because your income was too low, attach a typed or printed explanation.  If you were not required to file a Federal income tax return under U.S. tax law for any other reason, attach a typed or printed explanation including evidence of the exemption and how you are subject to it. Residence outside of the United States does not exempt U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents from filing a U.S. Federal income tax return. See Filing Requirements in the IRS Form 1040 Filing \nInstructions to determine whether you were required to file. \nFor purposes of this affidavit, the line for Total Income on IRS Forms 1040 and 1040A will be considered when \ndetermining income. For persons filing IRS Form 1040 EZ, the line for adjusted gross income will be considered. \nObtaining T ax T ranscripts. Y ou may use IRS Form 4506-T to request tax transcripts from the IRS.

Use of Assets to Supplement Income  (Optional) \nOnly complete Part 7. if you need to use the value of assets to meet the income requirements. If your Current Annual \nHousehold Income (indicated in Part 6., Item Number 12.) is equal to or more than needed to meet the income \nrequirement as shown by the current Federal Poverty Guidelines (Form I-864P) for your household size (indicated in Part \n5., Item Number 8.), you do not need to complete Part 7. If your total household income does not meet the requirement, \nyou may submit evidence of the value of your assets, the sponsored immigrant’ s assets, and/or assets of household \nmembers that can be used, if necessary , for the support of the intending immigrants.  The value of assets of all of these \npersons may be combined in order to meet the necessary requirement. \nOnly assets that can be converted into cash within one year and without considerable hardship or financial loss to the \nowner may be included. The owner of the asset must include a description of the asset, proof of ownership, and the basis for the owner’s claim of its net cash value. \nYou may include the net value of your home as an asset.  The net value of the home is the appraised value of the home, \nminus the sum of any and all loans secured by a mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the home. If you wish to include \nthe net value of your home, then you must include documentation demonstrating that you own it, a recent appraisal by a licensed appraiser, and evidence of the amount of any and all loans secured by a mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the home. You may not include the net value of an automobile unless you show that you have more than one automobile, and at least one automobile is not included as an asset. \nItem Numbers 1. - 4. Assets. T o use your own assets, you must complete Part 7., Item Numbers 1. - 4. and submit \ncorresponding evidence with this affidavit. Supporting evidence must be attached to establish location, ownership, date of acquisition, and value of any real estate holding. Supporting evidence of any liens or liabilities against these assets must also be provided. \nItem Number 5.  Household Member’s Assets. T o use the assets of a relative (spouse, adult son or daughter, parent, \nor sibling), the relative must reside with you and have completed Form I-864A with accompanying evidence of assets.  \nForm I-864A and accompanying evidence of assets is submitted with Form I-864.  Y ou may use the assets of more than \none relative who resides with you so long as you submit a complete Form I-864A with evidence of assets for each such \nrelative. Item Numbers 6. - 9. Assets of the Intending Immigrant. You may use the assets of the intending immigrant \nregardless of where he or she resides. The intending immigrant must provide evidence of such assets with this affidavit. \nAdd together Item Numbers 6. - 8. and type or print the total number in Item Number 9.  Form I-864A is not required to \ndocument the intending immigrant’s assets. \nItem Number 10.  T otal V alue of Assets. In order to qualify based on the value of your assets, the total value of you r \nassets must equal at least five times the difference between your total household income and the current Federal Poverty \nGuidelines for your household size. However, if you are a U.S. citizen and you are sponsoring your spouse or child 18 years of age or older, the total value of your assets must only be equal to at least three times the difference.  If the intending immigrant is a foreign national orphan who will be adopted in the United States after he or she acquires legal permanent residence, and who will, as a result, acquire citizenship under section 320 of the INA, the total value of your assets need only equal the difference. \nExample of How to Use Assets: If you are petitioning for a parent and the poverty line for your household size is \n$22,062 and your current income is $18,062, the difference between your current income and the poverty line is $4,000. \nIn order for assets to help you qualify, the combination of your assets, plus the assets of any household member who is signing Form I-864A, plus any available assets of the sponsored immigrant, would have to equal five times this difference (5 x $4,000). In this case, you would meet the income requirements if the net value of the assets equaled at least $20,000. \nPart 8. Sponsor’s Contract, Contact Information, Certification, and Signature \nRead the contract carefully , then sign and date the affidavit. If you do not sign and date the affidavit, the intending \nimmigrant you are sponsoring cannot be issued a visa or be granted adjustment of status.\n\nForm I-864 Instructions  10/17/24  Page 13 of 18 \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Item Numbers 1. - 6.

Contact Information, Declaration, and Signature of the Person Preparing this Affidavit, if Other Than the \nSponsor \nItem Numbers 1. - 6. The person who completed your affidavit, if other than the sponsor , must sign this section.  If the \nsame individual acted as your interpreter and your preparer, then that person should complete both Part 9. and Part 10.  A \nstamped or typewritten name in place of a signature is not acceptable. \nPart 11.  Additional Information \nItem Numbers 1. - 7. If you need extra space to provide any additional information within this affidavit, use the space \nprovided in Part 11. Additional Information. If you need more space than what is provided in Part 11., you may make \ncopies of Part 11. to complete and file with your affidavit or attach a separate sheet of paper .  Type or print your name and \nA-Number (if any) at the top of each sheet; indicate the Page Number, Part Number, and Item Number to which your \nanswer refers; and sign and date each sheet. \nWe recommend that you print or save a copy of your completed affidavit for your records. \nSpecific Requirements \nWho Completes and Signs Form I-864? A sponsor completes and signs Form I-864.  A sponsor is required to be at least 18 years of age and domiciled in \nthe United States, or its territories or possessions (See Part 2. Information About You (Sponsor) section of these \nInstructions for more information on domicile). The petitioning sponsor must sign and complete Form I-864, even if a joint sponsor also submits an I-864 to meet the income requirement. The list below identifies who must become sponsors \nby completing and signing a Form I-864, when it is required. \n1. The U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national who filed Form I-129F , Petition for Alien Fiancé(e), for a \nfiancé(e); Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, for a family member; Form I-600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an \nImmediate Relative, for an orphan; or Form I-800, Petition to Classify Convention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative, \nfor a Convention adoptee. \n2. The U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national who filed Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien \nWorker, for a spouse, parent, son, daughter, or sibling who:  \nA. Has a significant ownership interest (five percent or more) in the business which filed the employment-based \nimmigrant visa petition; or \nB. Is related to the intending immigrant as a spouse, parent, son, daughter , or sibling. \nWhat Are the Income Requirements? \nTo qualify as a sponsor, you must demonstrate that your income is at least 125 percent of the current Federal Poverty \nGuidelines for your household size. The Federal poverty line, for purposes of this affidavit, is updated annually and can be found on Form I-864P, Poverty Guidelines, on the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov.\n\nForm I-864 Instructions  10/17/24  Page 14 of 18 \n   \n \n \n \n \n If you are on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, or Coast Guard, and \nyou are sponsoring your spouse or minor child, you only need to have an income of 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for your household size. This provision does not apply to joint or substitute sponsors. \nHow Do I Count Household Size? \nYour household size includes yourself and the following individuals, no matter where they live:  any spouse, any \ndependent children under 21 years of age, any other dependents listed on your most recent Federal income tax return, all persons being sponsored in this affidavit of support, and any immigrants previously sponsored with Form I-864 or Form I-864 EZ, Affidavit of Support Under Section 213A of the INA, whom you are still obligated to support.  If necessary to meet the income requirements to be a sponsor, you may include additional relatives (adult children, parents, or siblings) as part of your household size as long as they have the same principal residence as you and promise to use their income and resources in support of the intending immigrants. \nWhat if I Cannot Meet the Income Requirements? \nIf your income alone is not sufficient to meet the requirement for your household size, the intending immigrant will be \nineligible for an immigrant visa or adjustment of status, unless the requirement can be met using any combination of the following: \n1. Income from any relatives or dependents living in your household or dependents listed on your most recent Federal \nincome tax return who signed Form I-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member; \n2. Income from the intending immigrant, if that income will continue from the same source after immigration, and if the intending immigrant is currently living in your residence.  If the intending immigrant is your spouse, his or her income can be counted regardless of current residence, but it must continue from the same source after he or she becomes a lawful permanent resident; \n3. The value of your assets, the assets of any household member who has signed Form I-864A, or the assets of the intending immigrants; or \n4. A joint sponsor whose income and/or assets equal at least 125 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines.  (See the What is a Joint Sponsor  section of these Instructions for more information.) \nHow Can My Relatives and Dependents Help Me Meet the Income Requir ements? \nYou may use the income of your spouse and/or any other relatives living in your residence if they are willing to be jointly responsible with you for the intending immigrants you are sponsoring. If you have any unrelated dependents listed on \nyour Federal income tax return you may include their income regardless of where they reside. \nThe income of such household members and dependents can be used to help you meet the income requirements if they \ncomplete and sign Form I-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member , and if they are at least 18 years of \nage when they sign the affidavit. \nCan the Intending Immigrant Help Me Meet the Income Requirements? \nIf certain conditions are met, an intending immigrant’s income can help you meet the income requirement.  If the \nintending immigrant is your spouse, his or her income can be included if it will continue from the same source after he or she obtains lawful permanent resident status. \nIf the intending immigrant is another relative, there are two requirements: \n1. The income must be continuing from the same source after he or she obtains lawful permanent resident status; and \n2. The intending immigrant must currently live with you in your residence.\n\nForm I-864 Instructions  10/17/24  Page 15 of 18 \n   Evidence must be provided to support both requirements, however, an intending immigrant whose income is being used \nto meet the income requirement does not need to complete Form I-864A, Contract Between Sponsor and Household Member, unless the intending immigrant has a spouse and/or children immigrating with him or her.  In this instance, the contract relates to support for the spouse and/or children. \nHow Can I Use Assets to Qualify? \nYou may use assets to supplement income if the consular or immigration officer is convinced that the monetary value of \nthe asset could reasonably be made available to support the sponsored immigrant and converted to cash within one year without undue harm to the sponsor or his or her family members. You may not include an automobile unless you show \nthat you own at least one working automobile that you have not included. \nWhat is a Joint Sponsor? \nIf the person who is seeking the immigration of one or more of his or her relatives cannot meet the income requirements, a \njoint sponsor who can meet the requirements may submit Form I-864 to sponsor all or some of the family members. \nA joint sponsor can be any U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national who is at least 18 years of age, \ndomiciled in the United States, or its territories or possessions, and willing to be held jointly liable with the petitioner for the support of the intending immigrant. A joint sponsor does not have to be related to the petitioning sponsor or the intending immigrant. \nIf the first joint sponsor completes Form I-864 for some rather than all the family members, a second qualifying joint \nsponsor will be required to sponsor the remaining family members. There may be no more than two joint sponsors. A \njoint sponsor must be able to meet the income requirements for all the persons he or she is sponsoring without combining resources with the petitioning sponsor or a second joint sponsor .  Any dependents applying for an immigrant visa or \nadjustment of status more than six months after immigration of the intending immigrants must be sponsored by the petitioner but may be sponsored by an original joint sponsor or a different joint sponsor . \nNOTE: Even if one or more Form I-864s are submitted for an intending immigrant, the petitioning sponsor remains \nlegally accountable for the financial support of the sponsored immigrant along with the joint sponsors. The petitioning \nsponsor must complete and submit a signed Form I-864 for the intending immigrant even if a joint sponsor will be used. The petitioning sponsor must also provide his or her Federal income tax return for the most recent tax year with supporting tax documents unless otherwise not required to file a Federal income tax return for the most recent tax year . \nWhat Is a Substitute Sponsor? \nA substitute sponsor is a sponsor who is completing Form I-864 on behalf of an intending immigrant whose original Form \nI-130 petitioner has died after Form I-130 was approved, but before the intending immigrant obtained legal permanent residence. \nThe substitute sponsor must be related to the intending immigrant in one of the following ways: spouse, parent, mother-\nin-law, father-in-law, sibling, child (at least 18 years of age), son, daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, \nsister-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, or legal guardian.  The substitute sponsor must also be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national. \nIf you are a substitute sponsor, you must indicate that you are related to the intending immigrant in one of the ways listed \nabove and include evidence proving that relationship. The beneficiary must also file this affidavit along with a typed or printed statement explaining the reasons why the Form I-130 visa petition should be reinstated, having been revoked following the petitioner’s death.  The beneficiary must also include a copy of the Form I-130 approval notice. \nHow Long Does My Obligation as a Sponsor Continue? \nYour obligation to support the immigrants you are sponsoring in this Affidavit of Support will continue until the sponsored \nimmigrant becomes a U.S. citizen, or can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters of work in the United States.\n\nForm I-864 Instructions  10/17/24  Page 16 of 18 \n   \n \n    \n  \n  \n Although 40 qualifying quarters of work (credits) generally equates to 10 years of work, in certain cases the work of a \nspouse or parent adds qualifying quarters. The Social Security Administration can provide information on how to count qualifying quarters (credits) of work. \nThe obligation also ends if you or the sponsored immigrant dies or if the sponsored immigrant ceases to be a lawful \npermanent resident. Divorce does not end the sponsorship obligation. \nDo I Need to Submit a Separate Affidavit for Each Family Member? \nYou must submit a Form I-864 Affidavit of Support for each intending immigrant you are sponsoring.  You may submit \nphotocopies if you are sponsoring more than one intending immigrant listed on the same affidavit of support. \nSeparate affidavits of support are required for intending immigrants for whom different Form I-130, Form I-600, or \nForm I-800 family-based petitions were filed. For instance, if you are sponsoring both parents, each will need an original affidavit of support and accompanying documentation since you were required to submit separate Form I-130 visa petitions for each parent. Often a spouse or minor children obtain visas or adjust status as dependents of a relative, based on the same visa petition. If you are sponsoring such dependents, you only need to provide a photocopy of the original Form I-864, as long as these dependents are immigrating at the same time as the principal immigrant or within six months of the time he or she immigrates to the United States. You do not need to provide copies of the supporting documents for each of the photocopied Form I-864s. \nWhere To File? \nPlease see our website at www.uscis.gov/i-864 for the most current information about where to file this affidavit. \nAddress Change \nIf you are a sponsor and are not a U.S. citizen, you must notify USCIS of your new address within 10 days of moving from your previous residence. T o do this, you must complete and file Form I-865, Sponsor’s Change of Address.  For information on filing Form I-865, go to our website at https://www.uscis.gov/i-865 or call the USCIS Contact Center. \nNOTE: Do not complete Form I-865 at the same time that you complete Form I-864. You should complete and \nsubmit Form I-865 to USCIS only when the address you indicated on the original Form I-864 has changed. \nThis requirement does not relieve a lawful permanent resident sponsor from filing a change of address within 10 days of \nthe change. For information on changing your address, go to our website at www.uscis.gov/addresschange or call the \nUSCIS Contact Center. NOTE:  Do not submit a change of address request to the USCIS Lockbox. For information on reporting a change of \naddress to DOS during consular processing, see www.travel.state.gov. \nProcessing Information \nInitial Processing.  Once USCIS or DOS accepts your affidavit, we will check it for completeness.  If you do not properly \ncomplete this affidavit, you will not establish a basis for your eligibility and USCIS or DOS may reject or deny your affidavit \nRequests for More Information. USCIS may request that you provide more information or evidence to support your \naffidavit. W e may also request that you provide the originals of any copies you submit.  If we request an original \ndocument from you, we will return it to you after USCIS determines it is no longer needed.\n\nForm I-864 Instructions  10/17/24  Page 17 of 18 \n   \n  \n Requests for Interview.  W e may request that you appear at a USCIS office for an interview based on your affidavit.  \nDuring your interview, USCIS may require you to provide your fingerprints, photograph, and/or signature to verify your \nidentity and/or update background and security checks. \nDecision. The decision on the sufficiency of Form I-864 involves a determination of whether you have established \nthat you can maintain the intending immigrants and the rest of your household at 125 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines (or 100 percent if you are on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces or U.S. Coast Guard and sponsoring your \nspouse or child). \nUSCIS Forms and Information \nTo ensure you are using the latest edition of this affidavit, visit www.uscis.gov. If filing with DOS, see www.travel.state.gov. \nPenalties \nIf you knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal a material fact or submit a false document with your Form I-864, we will deny your Form I-864 and may deny any other immigration benefit. In addition, you will face severe penalties provided \nby law and may be subject to criminal prosecution. \nThe U.S. Government may pursue verification of any information provided on or in support of this affidavit, including \nemployment, income, or assets with the employer, financial or other institutions, the IRS, or the Social Security Administration. If you include in this affidavit of support any information that you know to be false, you may be liable for criminal prosecution under the laws of the United States. \nIf you fail to provide notice of your change of address, as required by 8 U.S.C. 1 183a(d) and 8 CFR 213a.3, you may be \nliable for the civil penalty established by 8 U.S.C. 1183a(d)(2).  The amount of the civil penalty will depend on whether \nyou failed to provide this notice because you were aware that the immigrants you sponsored had received Federal, state, or local means-tested public benefits. \nIf the failure to report your change of address occurs with knowledge that the sponsored immigrant received means-\ntested public benefits (other than benefits described in section 401(b), 403(c)(2), or 4ll(b) of the Personal Responsibility and W ork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which are summarized in Part 8. Sponsor’s Contract, Contact \nInformation, Certification, and Signature of Form I-864) such failure may result in a fine of not less than $2,000 or more than $5,000. Otherwise, the failure to report your change of address may result in a fine not less than $250 or more than $2,000. \nDHS Privacy Notice \nAUTHORITIES: The information requested on this affidavit, and the associated evidence, is collected under the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) sections 212(a)(4) and 213A. \nPURPOSE: The primary purpose for providing the requested information on this affidavit is for you, the sponsor, \nto demonstrate that you meet the eligibility requirements to execute this contract between a sponsor and the U.S. \nGovernment that imposes on the sponsor, a legally enforceable obligation to support a sponsored alien until the obligation terminates.

If a sponsored alien receives means-tested public benefits, the benefit granting agency can request repayment from the sponsor and household member to recoup the cost of any benefits paid. If the sponsor or household member fails to repay the cost of the means-tested public benefits, the benefit granting agency may sue the sponsor and household member, who will be liable for the cost of the benefits, legal fees, and other associated costs. Household members should not take on this obligation if they are not prepared to follow through on the financial commitment.\nUse this form if you are a household member and want to promise to make your income and/or assets available to help support a sponsored immigrant.\nForms and Document Downloads\nForm I-864A\n(PDF, 473.04 KB)\nInstructions for Form I-864A\n(PDF, 286.03 KB)\nForm Details\nEdition Date\n10/17/24\n.\nYou can find the edition date at the bottom of the page on the form and instructions.\nDates are listed in mm/dd/yy format.\nIf you complete and print this form to mail it, make sure that the form edition date and page numbers are visible at the bottom of all pages and that all pages are from the same form edition.

A separate Form I-864A must be used for each household member whose income and/\nor assets are being used by a sponsor to qualify.  Each Form I-864A must be completed and signed by two individuals:  \nthe sponsor who is completing Form I-864 and a household member of the sponsor who is promising to make his or \nher income and/or assets available to help support the sponsored immigrant(s).  The combined signing of this contract \nconstitutes an agreement that the household member is jointly responsible, along with the sponsor, for the support of the \nindividual(s) named in this contract.\nForm I-864A must be submitted with Form I-864.\nForm I-864A may only be used when a sponsor’s income and assets do not meet the income requirements of Form I-864 \nand the qualifying household member chooses to combine his or her resources with the income and/or assets of a sponsor \nto meet the requirements.  The obligations of the household member under this contract terminate when the obligations of \nthe sponsor under the Affidavit of Support terminate.\nFor additional information, see the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 213A and part 213a of Title 8 of the \nCode of Federal Regulations.\nWhat Is a Sponsor?\nA sponsor can be one of the following:\n1. The petitioning relative;\n2. A relative with a significant ownership interest in the petitioning entity; \n3. A substitute in the case of a deceased petitioner, or another person accepting joint and several liability with the \nsponsor; or \n4. Another person accepting joint and several liability with the sponsor; AND\n5. Someone who completes and files Form I-864 on behalf of an intending immigrant.  A sponsor must be an individual \nand may not be an enterprise, a business, or any other type of organization.\nWho May Be Considered a Household Member for Purposes of Form I-864A? \nFor purposes of this contract, one or more of the following individuals may sign the Form I-864A  as a household member \nif at least 18 years of age:\n1. The intending immigrant, if the sponsor seeks to rely on the intending immigrant’ s continuing income to establish the \nsponsor’s ability to support the intending immigrant’s spouse or children;\n2. The spouse of the sponsor;\n3. The parent, child, adult son or daughter, or sibling relative of the sponsor, if that relative has the same principal \nresidence as the sponsor; or \n4. Any other individual whom the sponsor has lawfully claimed as a dependent on the sponsor ’s most recent Federal \nincome tax return even if that person does not live at the same residence as the sponsor .  If more than one individual \nagrees to help support the sponsored immigrant, each individual must sign a separate Form I-864A.\n\nForm I-864A Instructions   10/17/24    Page 2 of 9\nHow Can the Intending Immigrant Be Considered a Household Member?\nListed below are two ways that the intending immigrant may be considered a household member for the purposes of \npooling income with the sponsor to meet the Affidavit of Support requirements:\n1. The intending immigrant has the same principal residence as the sponsor and the intending immigrant can establish \nthat his or her income will continue from a lawful source, even after acquisition of lawful permanent residence; or\n2. The intending immigrant is the sponsor’s spouse and the intending immigrant can show that his or her income will \ncontinue from a lawful source after acquisition of lawful permanent residence.\nWhy Does a Household Member Complete Form I-864A?\nA household member completes this contract if the household member’s income and/or assets will be used to demonstrate \nthe sponsor’s ability to meet the income requirements and to maintain the sponsored immigrant at an annual income at the \nlevel specified in INA section 213A(f)(l)(E) or section 213A(f)(3).\nIf the Intending Immigrant Is a Household Member, Must He or She Complete This Contract?\nIf you are the intending immigrant and the sponsor is including your income on Form I-864 to meet the eligibility \nrequirements, you need to complete this contract only if you have accompanying dependents.  If you are the intending \nimmigrant and the sponsor is including only your assets on Form I-864, you do not need to complete this contract, even if \nyou have accompanying dependents.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ is \nlegally required for many family-based immigrants to show that the intending immigrant has adequate means of financial \nsupport and is unlikely to become a public charge.  \nWho May Use Form I-864EZ?\nY ou may use Form I-864EZ if ALL  the following conditions apply:\n1. Y ou are the person who filed or is filing Form I-129F, Petition for Alien Fiancé(e); Form I-130, Petition for Alien \nRelative; Form I-600, Petition to Classify Orphan as an Immediate Relative; or Form I-800, Petition to Classify \nConvention Adoptee as an Immediate Relative, for the relative you are sponsoring.\n2. The relative you are sponsoring is the only person listed on Form I-130; and\n3. The income you are using to qualify is based entirely on your salary or pension and is shown on one or more Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) Form W-2s provided by your employers or former employers.\nWhen Not To Use Form I-864EZ?\nDo not use Form I-864EZ if any of the following conditions apply .  Instead, you must complete and submit Form I-864.\n1. The relative you are sponsoring is not the only person immigrating based upon the underlying visa petition.\n2. Y ou filed or are filing Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien W orker, for the immigrant you are sponsoring.\n3. Y ou are a joint sponsor.\n4. Y ou are a substitute sponsor filing because the original Form I-130 petitioner is deceased.\n5. Your salary or pension is not enough to meet the income requirements as set by the Federal Poverty Guidelines.\n6. You are exempt from, or otherwise not required to, submit an Affidavit of Support under Section 213A of the INA.  \nFor more information, see Form I-864 Instructions, Are There Exceptions to Who Needs to Submit Form I-864, \nand Other Applicants Not Required to Submit Form I-864.\nHow Is Form I-864EZ Used?\nThis affidavit is a contract between a sponsor and the U.S. Government. The person completing and signing this affidavit \nis the sponsor.  By signing Form I-864EZ, you are agreeing to use your income and resources to support the intending \nimmigrant named in this affidavit, if it becomes necessary . Y ou must show on this affidavit that you have enough income \nto ensure that the sponsored immigrant will not have to rely on means-tested public benefits for support in the United \nStates.\n\nForm I-864EZ Instructions   10/17/24    Page 2 of 10\nIn most cases, the submission of this affidavit will make the sponsored immigrant ineligible for Federal, state, or local \nmeans-tested public benefits, because an agency that provides means-tested public benefits will consider your income and \nresources available to the sponsored immigrant in determining eligibility for the program.\nIf the immigrant sponsored in this affidavit does receive a Federal, state, or local means-tested public benefit, the agency \nproviding the benefit may require you to repay the cost of those benefits. That agency can sue you if you do not repay the \ncost of the benefits provided.\n1. Who Completes Form I-864EZ?\nOnly the U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident, or U.S. national who filed Form I-129F, Form I-130, Form I-600, \nor Form I-800 for a family member, may complete this affidavit. A sponsor is required to be at least 18 years of age \nand domiciled in the United States, its territories, or possessions.  (See the Specific Instructions section of these \nInstructions.)\n2. What Are the Income Requirements?\nT o qualify as a sponsor, you must demonstrate that you have an income of at least 125 percent of the current Federal \nPoverty Guidelines for your household size. The Federal poverty line, for purposes of this affidavit, is updated \nannually and can be found on Form I-864P , Poverty Guidelines, at www.uscis.gov/I-864P .\nIf you are on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces or U.S. Coast Guard and you are sponsoring your spouse or minor \nchild, you only need to have an income of 100 percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines for your household size.\n3. How Do I Count Household Size?\nY our household size includes yourself and the following individuals, no matter where they live:\nA. Any spouse;  \nB. Any dependent children under 21 years of age;\nC. Any other dependents listed on your most recent Federal income tax return;\nD. The person being sponsored in this affidavit of support; and\nE. Any immigrants previously sponsored with a Form I-864 or Form I-864EZ affidavit of support whom you are still \nobligated to support.\n4. How Long Does My Obligation as a Sponsor Continue?\nYour obligation to support the immigrant you are sponsoring in this Form I-864EZ will continue until the sponsored \nimmigrant becomes a U.S. citizen, or can receive credit for 40 qualifying quarters of work in the United States. \nAlthough 40 qualifying quarters (credits) of work generally equates to 10 years of work, in certain cases, the work \nof a spouse or parent adds qualifying quarters toward eligibility .  The Social Security Administration can provide \ninformation on how to count qualifying quarters (credits) of work.  The obligation also ends if you or the sponsored \nimmigrant dies or if the sponsored immigrant ceases to be a lawful permanent resident and departs the United States.  \nDivorce does not end the sponsorship obligation.\nGeneral Instructions\nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

A Guatemalan national who: A. First entered the United States on or before October 1, 1990; \nB. Registered for benefits under the ABC settlement agreement (American Baptist Churches v.

You must submit your application at the same time as your parent or spouse, while your parent’s or spouse’s application is still pending with USCIS, or after your parent or spouse has already been granted suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal by USCIS.

To make an initial application before the Immigration Court, you must be in deportation or removal proceedings. \nWho May Be Eligible to Be Granted Relief? \nYou may be eligible for NACARA 203 relief from USCIS or EOIR if you fall into one of the categories described on Form I-881, Part 2., Item Numbers 1. - 4. if you show that you have had seven years of continuous physical presence in the United States, that during those seven years you were of good moral character and that you or your U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, parent, or child will experience extreme hardship if you are returned to your country.  In this instance, USCIS or EOIR can grant your application. \nYou may be eligible for NACARA 203 relief from EOIR if you fall into the category described on Form I-881, Part 2., \nItem Number 8. if you show that you have had three years of continuous physical presence in the United States, that \nduring those three years you were of good moral character and that you or your spouse, parent, or child who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident will experience extreme hardship if you are returned to your country. \nYou may be required to show ten years physical presence and a showing of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship \nupon your return to your country, if you are deportable or removable from the United States based on certain provisions in the immigration law.  Also, there are special provisions for individuals who have served in the U.S. military. \nWho Is Not Eligible for Relief by USCIS? \nUSCIS cannot grant your application for suspension of deportation if you are deportable under any of the following grounds found in the INA section 241(a), as it existed before April 1, 1997: \n1. Criminal grounds, paragraph (2); \n2. Failure to register and falsification of documents, paragraph (3); or \n3.

Deportable under failure to register and falsification of documents, INA  section 237(a) paragraph (3); or \n4.

S. citizen or a permanent resident). \nUSCIS cannot grant your Form I-881 if you are eligible to apply only as someone described in the Who May File Form \nI-881 section, Item Number 6. of these Instructions.

In addition to the documents described above, you must submit with your application copies of \nany documents that USCIS has issued to you. The immigration judge or USCIS asylum officer may require you to submit \nadditional records relating to your application for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal. These documents may include, but are not limited to, court records, payment of child support during the time you have been physically present in the United States, or documents relevant to extreme hardship. \nSubmitting Form I-881 with USCIS ABC Class Members Who Have Received a Final Order of Deportation \nIf you are an ABC class member who is eligible for a new asylum interview with USCIS under the ABC settlement \nagreement and you are under a final order of deportation that has not been executed (for example, you were ordered to be deported and have not left the United States), you cannot apply for suspension of deportation with USCIS unless you have filed and been granted a motion to reopen your deportation proceedings under 8 CFR 1003.43. Once the deportation \nproceedings have been reopened, you must ask the immigration judge to administratively close the proceedings so that you may proceed with your suspension of deportation application with USCIS. To apply with USCIS, you will need to submit to USCIS the fees and documents described in the What to Include With Your Application section (immediately \nbelow). \nWhat to Include With Your Application \nYou must send the following documents to the appropriate USCIS service center: 1. An original completed Form I-881 with all attachments and copies of each of your supporting documents; \n2. One copy of a completed Form I-881 with all attachments and copies of each of your supporting documents; and \n3. Two passport-style photographs of you that meet the requirements described in the Photographs section of these \nInstructions; and \n4. Proof of relationship to the spouse or parent who is applying for or has applied for suspension of deportation or \nspecial rule cancellation or removal under NACARA 203 (if you selected Part 2., Item Number 4.). \nBring the originals with you to your interview with an asylum officer . \nForm EOIR-40, Application for Suspension of Deportation, will not be accepted when applying for Section 203 NACARA relief after June 21, 1999, except in the following limited circumstance: If you filed Form EOIR-40, Application for \nSuspension of Deportation, before June 21, 1999, and are eligible to apply for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal with USCIS, then you may complete the first page of Form I-881 and submit it to USCIS together with the Form EOIR-40. Otherwise, USCIS will not accept Form EOIR-40 if you are applying for section 203 NACARA relief. \nIf you are filing Form I-881 or Form EOIR-40 with USCIS and you have an order to administratively close the \nproceedings issued by an immigration judge or Board of Immigration Appeals, you must attach a copy of the order to your application. \nInterview Process \nThe USCIS asylum office will notify you of the time, date, and place (address) of your interview .

The following people cannot serve as your interpreter: your attorney \nor representative of record, a witness testifying on your behalf at the interview, or, if you have an asylum application pending, a representative or employee of your country.  Quality interpretation may be crucial to your claim. You must obtain the interpreter before your interview. \nIf you do not bring a competent interpreter to your interview, USCIS may consider your inability to proceed \nwith the interview to be an unexcused failure to appear for the interview.  Any unexcused failure to appear for an interview may result in USCIS dismissing your application or referring it directly to the Immigration Court. \nIf you cannot attend the interview, you must send a written request to reschedule your interview as soon as you know that \nyou cannot attend. You must send your request to the USCIS asylum office that sent you the interview notice.  \nDecision Process and Admission of Deportability or Inadmissibility \nUSCIS cannot grant suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal unless you admit that you are \ninadmissible to or deportable from the United States. If USCIS determines that you are eligible for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal, you will be notified that USCIS has found you eligible for the benefit. At that time, you will be asked to sign an admission of deportability or inadmissibility.  If you have any concerns about this, you should consult with an attorney or representative before you submit this application to USCIS. \nIf USCIS grants you suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal, your status will be adjusted to that \nof a lawful permanent resident. If USCIS determines that you are not eligible for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal, and you appear to be inadmissible or deportable from the United States, you may be placed in removal proceedings or, if you previously were in proceedings before an immigration judge or the Board of Immigration Appeals, which were administratively closed, USCIS will move to reschedule those proceedings. At the same time, USCIS will refer your application to EOIR for adjudication in deportation or removal proceedings. \nHow to Apply With the Immigration Court \nIf you are in deportation or removal proceedings, you may apply for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation of removal with the Immigration Court, unless proceedings have been administratively closed because you are eligible for an asylum interview with USCIS under the terms of the ABC settlement agreement or you are a spouse, child, unmarried son, or unmarried daughter whose proceedings have been administratively closed because your spouse or parent has Form I-881 pending with USCIS. \nTo apply with the Immigration Court, you must follow the DHS Instructions for Submitting Certain Applications in \nImmigration Court and for Providing Biometric and Biographic Information to USCIS, Side B instructions.

S. nationally \nrecognized licensure or certification examination, or a test predicting the success on the licensure or certification \nexamination, is offered overseas the applicant must pass the examination or predictor test prior to receiving \ncertification.  Passage of a test predicting the success on the licensure or certification examination may be accepted \nonly if a majority of the states (and Washington, D.C.) licensing the profession in which the alien intends to work \nrecognize such a test. \n2.   The organization must have policies and procedures for the revocation of certificates at any time if it is determined \nthat the certificate holder was not eligible to receive the certificate at the time it was issued.  If the organization \nrevokes an individual's certificate, it must notify USCIS, via the Nebraska Service Center, and the appropriate state \nregulatory authority with jurisdiction over the individual's health care profession.  The organization may not re -issue a \ncertificate to an individual whose certificate has been revoked.   \nCriteria for Maintaining Accreditation\n1.   The organization must advise USCIS of any changes in purpose, structure, or activities of the organization or its  \nprogram(s). \n2.   The organization must advise USCIS of any major changes in the evaluation of credentials and examination \ntechniques, if any, or in the scope or objectives of such examinations.  Maintenance of Comprehensive and Current Information\n1.   The organization must maintain comprehensive and current information of the type necessary to evaluate foreign \neducational institutions and accrediting bodies for purposes of ensuring that the quality of foreign educational \nprograms is equivalent to those training the same occupation in the United States.  The organization must examine, \nevaluate, and validate the academic and clinical requirements applied to each country's accrediting body or bodies, or \nin countries not having such bodies, of the educational institution itself.  10. The organization must provide all qualified applicants with a certificate in a timely manner.  9.   The organization must publish due process policies and procedures for applicants to question eligibility \ndeterminations, examination or evaluation results, and eligibility status.  7.  The organization must implement policies and procedures to ensure that each applicant's examination results are held \nconfidential and delineate the circumstances under which the applicant's certification status may be made public.  \n8.   The organization must have a formal policy for renewing the certification if an individual's original certification has \nexpired before the individual first seeks admission to the United States or applies for adjustment of status.  Such \nprocedures must be restricted to updating information on licensure to determine the existence of any adverse action \nand the need to re-establish English competency.   \n3.   The organization must, upon request, submit to USCIS, or any organization designated by USCIS, information \nrequested of the organization and its programs for use in investigating allegations of noncompliance with standards \nand for general purposes of determining continued approval as an independent credentialing organization.\n\nForm I-905 Instructions   04/01/24   Page 5 of 7What Is Our Authority for Collecting This Information?\nWe request the information on this form to carry out the immigration laws contained in Title 8, U.S. Code, Section 1186.  \nThe organization, or individuals on behalf of the organization, do not have to give this information.  However, refusal to \ngive some or all of it may result in denial of the application.We need this information to determine whether a person is eligible for immigration benefits.

USCIS will conduct a review of your \norganization every 5 years to ensure continued compliance with the standards described.  The review will occur \nconcurrent with the adjudication of your request for reauthorization to issue health care worker certificates.  If USCIS \ndetermines that you are not complying with the terms of authorization, or if other adverse information is brought to \nUSCIS's attention, USCIS may proceed to terminate your authorization to issue health care worker certificates.   Are There Any Limitations If This Application Is Approved?5.   The organization must be in ongoing compliance with other policies specified by USCIS.  4.   The organization must establish performance outcome measures that track the ability of the certificate holders to pass \nU. S. licensure or certification examinations.  \nThe purpose of the process is to ensure that certificate holders pass U. S. licensure or certification examinations at the \nsame pass rate as graduates of the U. S. programs.  Failure to establish such measures, or having a record showing an \ninability of persons granted certificates to pass U. S. licensure examinations at the same rate as graduates of  U. S. \nprograms, may result in a ground for termination of approval.  Information regarding the passage rates of certificate \nholders must be maintained by the organization and provided to HHS on an annual basis, to USCIS as part of the 5-\nyear reauthorization application, and at any other time upon request by HHS or USCIS.\nSignature.

If you provide sufficient proof that you or your qualifying family member receive a means-tested benefit, your fee waiver will generally be approved.\nA means-tested benefit is a public benefit where a person’s eligibility for the benefit, the amount of the benefit, or both, \nis based on the person’s income and resources.  USCIS will consider means-tested benefits that are Federally, state, or locally funded and granted by the benefit agency. \nExamples of means-tested benefit programs are Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (known as \n“SNAP” and formerly called Food Stamps), Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI), or other public assistance.  Consult with your benefit-granting agency or your legal advisor to determine whether any Federal, state, or local public benefit that you may receive qualifies as a means-tested benefit. \nFor the purposes of determining an inability to pay the filing fee of the petition or application, the following are not \nconsidered means-tested benefits:  Medicare; unemployment benefits; Social Security retirement benefits; Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI); Social Security Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI); or student financial aid.\n1. Individual Receipt of a Means-Tested Benefit \nA. The individual must demonstrate personal receipt of a means-tested benefit.  When a parent is residing with a \nchild who is receiving public housing or Section 8 benefits, Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the parent is also considered to be receiving the means-tested benefit. \nB. If a child is the sole applicant, the child may provide an individual means-tested benefit or a custodial parent’ s \nmeans-tested benefit, if living in the same household. \nC. If multiple children are filing at the same time, each child must have an individual receipt of a means-tested \nbenefit or be under the parent’s household who is receiving a means-tested benefit.  USCIS considers children \nliving in the same household to be receiving the means-tested benefit if the parent(s) are also living in the same household.\n2. Family Member’ s Means-Tested Benefits\nA. Your spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age living with you will normally qualify for a fee waiver \nas part of your household if you are receiving means-tested benefits. \nB. If your spouse is receiving a means-tested benefit, you will normally qualify for a fee waiver as long as you are  \nresiding with your spouse and are not legally separated.\nC. Y ou may use a child’s public housing or Section 8 subsidy, Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, or SSI if the child is living in the same household.\n\nForm I-912 Instructions   07/22/25 Page 6 of 12\nD. If you are 21 years of age or older, you cannot use a parent’s means-tested benefits (such as SSI), even if the \nparent is living with you, as evidence of your eligibility for a fee waiver unless you are disabled and your parent is your legal guardian or surrogate .  However, you may use \ninformation about your parent’s means-tested benefits \nto support a fee waiver request under Part 6. Financial Hardship if the award letter or benefit approval document \nindicates the total household income and you are otherwise eligible under those criteria.\n3. Documentation\nA. T o qualify for a fee waiver, the evidence that you provide must demonstrate that you are currently receiving the means-tested benefit.  This evidence can be in the form of a letter, notice, or other agency documents that indicate that the benefit is being received.\nB. Documentation must contain:\n(1) Y our name (or the name of the person receiving the benefit);\n(2) The name of the agency granting the public benefit;\n(3) The type of benefit; and\n(4) An indication that the benefit is currently being received (for example, a recently dated letter or document  \nwith effective dates, date of renewal or period the approval ends, if available).\nC. If the documentation is more than 12 months old and the benefit is still being received, provide additional evidence that shows the benefit is currently being received.\nPart 5.  Income at or Below 150 Percent of the Federal Poverty Guidelines\nT o qualify for the fee waiver, your adjusted gross household income must be at or below 150 percent of the Federal Poverty \nGuidelines, at the time of filing, based on your household size.

Even if you, as a T-1 applicant, have another status that permits reentry into the U.S., it may be difficult to establish your physical presence on account of trafficking as required by 8 CFR 214.207 if you depart the U.S. after your trafficking has ended.   \nTravel After Your Form I-914 is Approved \nFor a T-1 nonimmigrant to depart the United States and return to the United States in T-1 nonimmigrant status, he or she \nmust file a Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and obtain advance parole prior to departure.\nA T-1 nonimmigrant who departs the United States and returns through means other than an advance parole document \nissued prior to departure or admission at a designated port of entry with a T nonimmigrant visa does not resume T nonimmigrant status and may have to reapply for such status. \nFor a T-2, T-3, T-4, T-5, or T-6 nonimmigrant to depart the United States and return to the United States in T nonimmigrant \nstatus, he or she must either: \n1. File a Form I-131, Application for Travel Documents, Parole Documents, and Arrival/Departure Records, and obtain advance parole prior to departure, or\n2. Apply for and receive a T nonimmigrant visa from the Department of State and seek admission as a T nonimmigrant at a designated port of entry. \nDecision\nThe decision on Form I-914 involves a determination of whether you have established eligibility for T nonimmigrant \nstatus.  You will be notified of our decision in writing.\nConfidentiality\nInformation concerning principal applicants for T nonimmigrant status and the family members they apply for is protected \nunder 8 U.S.C. Section 1367.  The disclosure of information relating to an individual with a pending or approved application for T nonimmigrant status is prohibited except in certain limited circumstances.  These circumstances may include, but are not limited to, disclosure of information to law enforcement agencies with the authority to detect, investigate, or prosecute severe forms of trafficking in persons; non-governmental victims’  service providers for the sole \npurpose of assisting victims in obtaining victim services from programs with expertise working with immigrant victims; and for purposes of national security.\nUSCIS Forms and Information\nTo ensure you are using the latest version of this application, visit www.uscis.gov.\nPenalties\nIf you knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal a material fact or submit a false document with your Form I-914, we will deny your Form I-914 and may deny any other immigration benefit.  In addition, you will face severe penalties provided by law and may be subject to criminal prosecution.\n\nDRAFT\nNot for\nProduction\n07/15/2025\nForm I-914 Instructions   01/20/25  Page 17 of 18\nDHS Privacy Notice\nAUTHORITIES:   The information requested on this application, and the associated evidence, is collected under Public \nLaw106-386 sections 107(e) and 1513(c) and 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(T).\nPURPOSE:  The primary purpose for providing the requested information on this application is to determine whether you \nhave established eligibility for the temporary immigration benefit you are applying for .

      "content": "I-918,\nPetition for U Nonimmigrant Status\nAlert Type info\nALERT:\nAs of Sept. 9, 2025, USCIS met the fiscal year 2025 statutory cap of 10,000 aliens who can be issued U-1 nonimmigrant visas or granted U-1 nonimmigrant status per fiscal year. We adjudicated petitions to meet the statutory cap based on filing date order, with the oldest petitions receiving highest priority. We have met this cap every year since fiscal year 2010. When the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, 2025, we will resume approving eligible principal petitions for U-1 nonimmigrant status starting with petitions filed on or before April 30, 2017, prioritizing the oldest petitions.\nWhile USCIS has reached the cap for fiscal year 2025, we will continue to conduct bona fide determination reviews and, where applicable, consider petitions for placement on the waiting list.\nIf you are an alien and are a victim of a qualifying criminal activity, use this form to petition for temporary immigration benefits for yourself and your qualifying family members, as appropriate.\nQuestions and Answers: U Status Bona Fide Determination Process\nQ1. What is the bona fide determination process?\nA1.\nBy statute, USCIS has discretion to provide employment authorization to aliens with pending, bona fide U nonimmigrant status petitions. In June 2021, we implemented the bona fide determination process with the goal of conducting initial reviews of U nonimmigrant status petitions more efficiently and providing eligible victims of qualifying crimes with employment authorization and deferred action while they wait for final adjudication of their petition for U nonimmigrant status under the annual statutory cap. This will provide victims with stability and better equip them to cooperate with and assist law enforcement.\nQ2. Who does the bona fide determination process apply to?\nA2.\nThis policy applies to all Form I-918 petitions and all Form I-918A petitions pending as of June 14, 2021, filed by principal petitioners and qualifying family members living in the United States, as well as Form I-918 petitions filed on or after this date by principal petitioners and their qualifying family members living in the United States. We do not consider principal petitioners and qualifying family members living outside of the United States for a bona fide determination because we cannot provide deferred action or employment authorization to petitioners outside the United States.\nQ3. When did USCIS begin implementing the bona fide determination process?\nA3.\nWe published the new bona fide determination process in the\nUSCIS Policy Manual\non June 14, 2021, and began adjudicating and issuing Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) shortly thereafter.\nQ4. In what order will USCIS adjudicate cases for a bona fide determination?\nA4.\nWe will generally adjudicate cases for bona fide determinations in receipt date order, starting with the oldest pending petitions that have not already gone through a waiting list adjudication as of June 14, 2021.\nQ5. I filed a petition for U nonimmigrant status several years ago. Will my petition now go through 3 different adjudications: bona fide determination, waiting list, and final adjudication? What happens if I was already placed on the waiting list before this policy was issued?\nA5.\nPrincipal petitioners and qualifying family members will not all go through 3 different adjudications. As of June 14, 2021, we began adjudicating pending, non-waitlisted petitions filed by aliens living in the United States in receipt date order for bona fide determinations.\nIf a principal petitioner has a bona fide petition, merits a favorable exercise of discretion, and has filed their Form I-765, we will issue the principal petitioner a bona fide determination EAD and deferred action. We will place their petition in the queue in receipt date order to wait for final adjudication for U nonimmigrant status. These petitioners will not have to go through a waiting list adjudication unless new, adverse information impacts their ability to maintain a bona fide determination EAD.\nPrincipal petitioners who we determine will not receive a bona fide determination EAD and deferred action will receive waiting list adjudication. If a principal petitioner receives waiting list adjudication, qualifying family members will also receive waiting list adjudication.\nPrincipal petitioners and their qualifying family members placed on the waiting list before June 14, 2021, do not need to go through the bona fide determination process because they already can receive an EAD and deferred action. Petitioners placed on the waiting list before June 14, 2021, will be adjudicated for U nonimmigrant status in receipt date order at the same time as petitioners who received bona fide determination EADs and deferred action.\nQ6. How are bona fide determinations for principal petitioners different from qualifying family members?\nA6.\nA qualifying family member will not have access to a bona fide determination review unless and until the principal petitioner receives a bona fide determination. We will first determine whether a principal petitioner living in the United States may receive a bona fide determination before we make a bona fide determination for any associated qualifying family member living in the United States. A principal petition is bona fide if:\nThe principal petitioner properly filed\nForm I-918\n;\nThe principal petitioner included a properly completed law enforcement certification (\nForm I-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification\n);\nThe principal petitioner included a personal statement describing the facts of the victimization; and\nWe received the results of the principal petitioner’s background and security checks based on biometrics.\nWe then assess the principal petitioner’s eligibility for a bona fide determination by considering whether they merit a positive exercise of discretion, including consideration of national security or public safety risks.\nAfter the principal petitioner receives a bona fide determination, we will evaluate the petitions of any qualifying family members living in the United States to assess whether they are eligible to receive a bona fide determination.\nIf the principal petitioner receives a bona fide determination, this does not guarantee a qualifying family member living in the United States will receive a bona fide determination. The record must independently demonstrate the qualifying family member’s\nForm I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient\n, is bona fide. A qualifying family member’s petition is bona fide if:\nThe principal petitioner receives a bona fide determination;\nThe petitioner has properly filed\nForm I-918, Supplement A\n;\nThe petition includes credible evidence of the qualifying family relationship; and\nWe receive the results of the qualifying family member’s background and security checks based on biometrics.\nAs with principal petitioners, we then consider whether the qualifying family member living in the United States merits a favorable exercise of discretion to receive a bona fide determination.\nFor more information on the bona fide determination process for principal petitioners, please see the USCIS Policy Manual Appendix:\nBona Fide Determination Process Flowchart\n. For more information on the bona fide determination process for qualifying family members, please see\nChapter 5: Bona Fide Determination, A. Bona Fide Determination, 2. Qualifying Family Members\n.\nQ7. What do I need to file to receive a bona fide determination EAD?\nA7.\nWe will initiate bona fide determination adjudication of pending petitions not already placed on the waiting list. Principal petitioners, qualifying family members, and counsel do not need to take any action.\nWe are reviewing pending petitions filed by petitioners living in the United States in receipt date order. Petitioners will not need to submit an additional request. We will send petitioners a notice to file a\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, if they have not done so already.\nQ8. I did not previously file Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, with my U visa petition. What should I do?\nA8.\nWe encourage petitioners to submit a\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, concurrently with their Form I-918 or Form I-918A. This will enable us to act efficiently on their case when it is current for consideration under the bona fide determination process. Please note that there is no fee for an initial bona fide determination EAD.\nIf you have a pending Form I-918 or Form I-918A and have not already submitted a\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\n, please submit Form I-765 now to the appropriate address in the “Where to File” section on the\nForm I-918\nwebpage.\nIf a petitioner has already filed Form I-765 under\n8 CFR 274a.12(a)(19), (a)(20) or (c)(14)\nand we determined they will receive a bona fide determination EAD and deferred action, they will not need to submit another Form I-765.\nFor additional information, please see\nChapter 5: Bona Fide Determination, C. Adjudicative Process, 2. Previously Filed Form I-765 for Bona Fide Determination Process\n.\nQ9. Can petitioners still file Forms I-918 and I-765 together, or should we wait until USCIS issues a bona fide determination notice?\nA9.\nWe recommend that principal petitioners and their qualifying family members file\nForm I-765, Application for Employment Authorization\nwith their initial filings. Principal petitioners and qualifying family members may file a Form I-765 under a (c)(14) category for a bona fide determination EAD or if their petition is placed on the waiting list.\nQ10. I am a new petitioner. Do I need to submit a fee or a fee waiver with my Form I-765 for the waiting list (under 8 CFR (c)(14))? Do I need to submit a fee or a fee waiver for the bona fide determination EAD?\nA10.\nWe do not charge a fee to file certain victim-based and humanitarian benefit requests, including\nForm I-918\n, and the initial\nForm I-765\nassociated with this form.\nIf a petitioner (principal petitioner or qualifying family member) does not file their Form I-765 concurrently with their Form I-918 and we determine they may receive a bona fide determination EAD, we will issue a notice indicating that they have received a bona fide determination, merit a favorable exercise of discretion, and may receive a bona fide determination EAD if they file Form I-765.\nPetitioners do not need to submit a filing fee for\nForm I-765\nassociated with the bona fide determination EAD.\nPetitioners do not need to submit a filing fee for Form I-765 associated with waiting list placement.\nQ11. Do I need to submit proof of economic necessity or file a Form I-765 worksheet?\nA11.\nNo, principal petitioners and their qualifying family members do not need to submit proof of economic necessity or file a Form I-765 worksheet to receive a bona fide determination EAD.\nQ12. I received a bona fide determination notice from the Vermont Service Center, but I live in California and the website says I should send my Form I-765 to Nebraska. What should I do?\nA12.\nPlease follow the directions included in the bona fide determination notice. For example, if you received a bona fide determination notice from the Vermont Service Center, send your Form I-765 to the Vermont Service Center.\nQ13. Will you refund my filing fee if my Form I-765 under 8 CFR (a)(20) or (c)(14) is converted to a bona fide determination EAD?\nA13.\nWe cannot refund the filing fee for a previously submitted Form I-765 filed under 8 CFR (a)(20) and (c)(14). Petitioners do not need to submit a filing fee for the initial Form I-765 associated with a bona fide determination EAD or EAD based on waiting list placement. Petitioners also do not need to submit a filing fee or fee waiver if they choose to renew their bona fide determination EAD or waiting list placement EAD.\nQ14. Will I have an opportunity to submit additional information so I can receive a bona fide determination EAD?\nA14.\nWhen we determine a principal petitioner will not be granted a bona fide determination EAD and deferred action, we will issue a Request for Evidence (RFE) stating that we will not grant a bona fide determination EAD and deferred action and request the additional evidence we need for the waiting list adjudication.\nConsequently, a principal petitioner who does not receive a bona fide determination EAD and deferred action still is able to obtain employment authorization and a grant of deferred action through waiting list placement, if they are found eligible for U nonimmigrant status but for the annual statutory cap. If we determine that the principal petitioner can be placed on the waiting list, that decision generally does not affect the timeline in which we adjudicate the petition for final determination of U nonimmigrant status. A determination that a petitioner (principal petitioner or qualifying family member) will not receive a bona fide determination EAD and deferred action is not a denial of Form I-918 (or Form I-918A) or the initial Form I-765.\nQ15. My family member was living outside of the United States when I filed my Form I-918. Does that mean my family member will not receive a bona fide determination? Do I need to request the bona fide determination and submit Form I-765 now that they are in the United States?\nA15.\nThe bona fide determination process is for principal petitioners and their qualifying family members living in the United States. We will generally adjudicate cases for bona fide determinations in receipt date order, starting with the oldest pending petitions that did not already go through a waiting list adjudication as of June 14, 2021.\nWe will initiate bona fide determination adjudications for pending petitions that are not already on the waiting list without any action required by principal petitioners, qualifying family members, or counsel. We first determine whether the principal petitioner may receive a bona fide determination. After the principal petitioner receives a bona fide determination, we then determine if the qualifying family member living in the United States may receive a bona fide determination.\nThe goal of the bona fide determination process is to address the significant increases in the volume of U nonimmigrant petitions and the backlog of petitions awaiting placement on the waiting list or final adjudication. All principal petitioners residing in the United States are considered for bona fide determination review, as this review saves limited agency resources and provides interim benefits to the greatest number of petitioners in a more efficient time frame. USCIS encourages the use of lawful, safe, and orderly processes for entering the United States.\nIf the qualifying family member has updated their current address with USCIS to show they are residing in the United States, we will review their petition for a bona fide determination EAD and no further action will be necessary. If a qualifying family member updates their current address with USCIS to show they are residing in the United States after the principal petitioner receives a bona fide determination, then there may be delays in the bona fide determination review process for the qualifying family member given workload and resource priorities. If the principal petitioner does not live in the United States when we review their petition, we will perform a waiting list adjudication.\nFollow the instructions at the\nHow to Change Your Address\nwebpage to update your address for Form I-918 or Form I-918A.\nQ16. How long will it take to receive my bona fide determination EAD?\nA16.\nWe are committed to adjudicating petitions in a timely and efficient manner. You can find current processing time information at the\nCheck Case Processing Times\nwebpage. The time range reflects the time from receipt to when we issue either a bona fide determination notice or a notice that we will consider the petition for waiting list placement. It does not reflect the current processing times from initial receipt to the final issuance of U nonimmigrant status.\nQ17. How does the bona fide determination process affect certifying officials?\nA17.\nThe bona fide determination process does not change the role of certifying officials who complete the law enforcement certification. We evaluate whether their Form I-918, Supplement B, meets initial evidence requirements during the bona fide determination process. We then consider whether their Form I-918, Supplement B, as well as the other evidence in the record, establishes eligibility during the final adjudication of Form I-918 when visas are available under the statutory cap. A complete and properly filed Form I-918, Supplement B, is a requirement for both the bona fide determination EAD and the final adjudication of Form I-918, so we encourage certifying officials to answer all questions on the form as fully as possible.\nQ18. Can I renew my bona fide determination EAD and grant of deferred action?\nA18.\nGenerally, yes. If we do not adjudicate a principal petitioner or qualifying family member’s petition for U nonimmigrant status before the 4-year validity period of the EAD and deferred action ends, the alien may apply for renewal according to the Form I-765 Instructions. If granted, the alien would receive a bona fide determination EAD and grant of deferred action for another 4-year validity period.\nAt any point during the validity period, we have the right to revoke a bona fide determination EAD and terminate the grant of deferred action if we determine that the bona fide determination EAD and deferred action are no longer warranted, or if we issued the prior bona fide determination EAD in error. For example, we may revoke the bona fide determination EAD and terminate the grant of deferred action if the Form I-918 Supplement B is withdrawn, or if, within our discretion, we determine a national security or public safety concern is present.\nFor more information, please see\nChapter 5: Bona Fide Determination, A. Bona Fide Determination, 6. Request to Renew Bona Fide Determination Employment Authorization Document and Deferred Action\n.\nQ19. How long will my bona fide determination EAD and grant of deferred action be valid?\nA19.\nAn initial bona fide determination EAD and grant of deferred action will be valid for 4 years. The grant of deferred action will begin on the issuance date listed on your EAD. The bona fide determination process provides both a bona fide determination EAD and a grant of deferred action to petitioners who meet the criteria; you cannot get either alone.\nPetitioners who do not receive a bona fide determination EAD and grant of deferred action, but who eventually receive waiting list placement, if eligible, will also receive an EAD and grant of deferred action for 4 years to promote consistency and fairness in the U program.\nQ20. How does the bona fide determination process impact petitioners who are in removal proceedings?\nA20.\nThe bona fide determination process satisfies the prima facie standard that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) previously requested in specific circumstances. The steps taken to determine whether a petition is bona fide and whether a petitioner receives a bona fide determination rely on the initial evidence submitted with a petition for U nonimmigrant status, as well as the results of background checks. We will continue to coordinate with ICE on individual cases as requested by ICE. See\nChapter 5: Bona Fide Determination, C. Adjudicative Process, 4. Prima Facie Approval\n.\nQ21: I have seen information posted by USCIS on the Policy Manual webpage. Are there other materials that USCIS or DHS has released to the public about the bona fide determination process?\nA21.\nWe have released the following materials:\nPM-V3-Part C: Bona Fide Determination Process\nPM-V3-Part C Appendix: Bona Fide Determination Process Flowchart\nVictims of Criminal Activity: U Nonimmigrant Status\nUSCIS Issues Policy Providing Further Protections for Victims of Crime News Release\nTwitter\n/\nTwitter-Spanish\nFacebook\n/\nFacebook-Spanish\nEnglish/Spanish Stakeholder Message\nQ22. Where else can I find more information about the bona fide determination process?\nA22.\nWe introduced the bona fide determination process in the\nUSCIS Policy Manual\non June 14, 2021. You can find information on the process in\nVolume 3, Part C, Chapter 5\n, as well as the Special Instructions sections of our\nForm I-765\nand\nForm I-918\npages. You can find a flowchart of the process for principal petitioners in the “appendices” tab in the USCIS Policy Manual.\nQ23. How can I stay up to date on USCIS policies?\nA23.\nYou can\nsign up to receive email notifications\nof new alerts from USCIS.\nForm I-918 Processing Priorities\nAfter receiving a Form I-918 from an alien in the United States, we begin a bona fide determination review of the principal petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(6). We will not begin a Form I-918A bona fide determination review for a qualifying family member until after the principal petitioner receives a favorable bona fide determination review. Depending on whether the Form I-918A is filed with or after the Form I-918, the principal petitioner may have already received a bona fide determination before we receive the Form I-918A. Bona fide determinations generally proceed in date-of-filing order.\nFrom late 2023 until early 2025, USCIS used data analysis to select certain Form I-918 petitions for a streamlined adjudicative process.  Streamlined bona fide determination adjudication was not used for petitions presenting certain factors, and those petitions received standard bona fide determination review. These factors included:\nNational security concerns;\nCertain criminal or public safety issues;\nSignificant inadmissibility grounds;\nAbsence of required evidence; or\nOther administrative processing issues.\nAs of February 4, 2025, the streamlined process has been suspended.\nIf we determine during the bona fide determination review that the petition requires a comprehensive eligibility determination, it will not receive a favorable bona fide determination. Instead, it will receive a standard waiting list review under 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2), which may include issuing requests for evidence or notices of intent to deny. Waiting list determinations and issuing these requests and notices require significantly more adjudication time per case, compared to cases without these complex issues.\nThese factors affect the overall time to complete a waiting list adjudicative review. However, all Form I-918 petitions are adjudicated under the statutory annual cap in receipt date order.\nForms and Document Downloads\nForm I-918\n(PDF, 686.44 KB)\nInstructions for Form I-918 and Form I-918, Supplement A\n(PDF, 440.06 KB)\nForm I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient\n(PDF, 692.94 KB)\nForm I-918, Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification\n(PDF, 415.12 KB)\nInstructions for Form I-918, Supplement B\n(PDF, 317.87 KB)\nForm Details\nEdition Date\n01/20/25\n.\nStarting May 5, 2025, we will accept only the 01/20/25 edition.

In this instance, you may choose to file additional evidence with Form I-918 to add to the evidence submitted with the request for interim relief.\nNOTE:  You may use one document to demonstrate more than one element of your claim.\n1. Supplement B.  You must submit an original, properly and timely executed Supplement B certification with your \nForm I-918.  However, petitioners who requested and received U interim relief are not required to file Supplement B.\nUSCIS will give this certification significant weight as evidence demonstrating that you are a victim; that you possess \ninformation about the criminal activity; that the criminal activity violated the laws of the United States or occurred in the United States (including Indian country and military installations) or the territories and possessions of the United States; and that you were, are, or are likely to be helpful in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity of which you are a victim.  You must also provide any additional relevant evidence to help meet these eligibility requirements.\n2. Evidence You Are the Victim of Qualifying Criminal Activity.  You must demonstrate you have suffered direct and proximate harm as a result of the commission of qualifying criminal activity. You must include with your Form I-918 evidence establishing you are a victim of qualifying criminal activity.

Affidavits; and\nF. Orders of protection.\n3. Evidence You Have Suffered Substantial Physical or Mental Abuse.

The severity of the perpetrator’s conduct;\nC. The severity of the harm you suffered;\nD. The duration of the infliction of the harm; and\nE. The extent to which there is permanent or serious harm to your appearance, health, or physical or  \nmental soundness.\nNo single factor is a prerequisite to establish that the abuse suffered was substantial, nor does the existence of one \nor more of the factors automatically create a presumption that the abuse was substantial.  If the criminal activity \ncaused the aggravation of a pre-existing physical or mental injury, USCIS will consider that aggravation in evaluating \nwhether the harm constitutes substantial physical or mental abuse.  If the criminal activity involved a series of acts \nor occurred repeatedly over a period of time, document the pattern of abuse.  USCIS will consider the abuse in its \ntotality.  USCIS may consider a series of acts taken together to have caused substantial physical or mental abuse even \nwhere no single act alone rises to that level.\nYou are encouraged to provide and document all credible evidence, particularly when documenting a pattern of abuse.  \nA non-exhaustive list of suggested forms of evidence includes, but is not limited to:\nA.

Birth certificate of the petitioner; \nB. Court documents demonstrating recognition of an individual as the petitioner ’s next friend; \nC. Medical records; or \nD. Reports of licensed medical professionals demonstrating the incapacity or incompetence of the petitioner.\n6. Evidence that Criminal Activity is Qualifying and Violated United States Law or Occurred in the United States.   \nYou must submit evidence that the criminal activity of which you are a victim is included in the list of criminal \nactivities contained in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the INA and included in these Instructions, and that the criminal \nactivity violated a U.S. Federal law that provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction, or occurred in the United States \n(including in Indian country and military installations) or the territories and possessions of the United States.\nYou may use Supplement B to help establish this eligibility requirement and include additional evidence you want \nUSCIS to consider.

A person who has been “paroled” into the country has not been admitted to the United States and remains an “applicant for admission” even while paroled.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as a matter of discretion, may grant advance parole and issue an Advance \nParole Document to enable you to appear at a U.S. Port of Entry to seek parole into the United States.  A transportation \ncompany (for example, a commercial airline) may accept the document in lieu of a visa as an authorization for the holder to travel to the United States.  An Advance Parole Document does not substitute for any required passport.\nWARNING:  A grant of advance parole or issuance of an Advance Parole Document does not entitle you to be paroled \ninto the United States.  Upon your arrival at a U.S. Port of Entry , a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer will \nmake a separate discretionary decision whether to parole you into the United States.WARNING:   DHS may revoke or terminate parole or an Advance Parole Document at any time, including while you are \noutside the United States.  In that event, you may be unable to return to the United States unless you have a valid visa or \nother document that permits you to travel to the United States and seek admission.\nWho May File Form I-941?\nAn entrepreneur may file Form I-941 to request consideration for parole for the entrepreneur .  Requests for parole for the \nspouse and children of an entrepreneur must be filed with Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, in accordance \nwith Form Instructions.\nOnly one entrepreneur may request parole per application.  \nAdditional entrepreneurs requesting parole through the same \nstart-up entity must file separate applications.If you are not currently in the United States based on a grant of parole, you must file this application to make an initial, \nadvance request for entrepreneur parole either from within the United States or while outside the United States.  Once approved, you then may request parole at a U.S. Port of Entry (airport, seaport, or land border) from CBP  after arriving \nfrom outside the United States.\nGeneral Instructions \nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

NOTE: You are not required to obtain evidence of your U.S. citizenship.  If you want evidence of your U.S. citizenship \nyou may submit Form N-600 to obtain a Certificate of Citizenship from USCIS, or you may apply for a U.S. passport with \nthe Department of State. See travel.state.gov for more information. \nWho Should File Form N-600? \nYou should file this application if: \n1. You are requesting a Certificate of Citizenship because you were born outside the United States to a U.S. citizen \nparent; or \n2. You are requesting a Certificate of Citizenship because you automatically became a citizen of the United States after birth, but before you turned 18 years of age. (A parent or legal guardian can also file Form N-600 on behalf of a minor child.) \nTo file this application, you must be the child of a U.S. citizen parent.  USCIS recognizes the following parent-child relationships for citizenship purposes: \n• The biological child of a U.S. citizen parent. (Your U.S. citizen parent must also be your legal parent.  If the U.S. citizen parent is your biological father, you will generally have to establish that you were born in wedlock or legitimated. In some cases, you may be able to provide a court order establishing paternity or evidence that your father acknowledged paternity in writing under oath instead of legitimation.) \n• The adopted child of a U.S. citizen parent. \n• The child of a non-genetic gestational U.S. citizen parent (person who carried and gave birth to the child) who is also your legal parent. \n• The child of a U.S. citizen parent who was married to your genetic or gestational parent at the time of your birth (even if no genetic or gestational relationship exists with the U.S. citizen parent) and both of your parents are also your legal parents. \nNOTE:  Stepchildren CANNOT acquire U.S. citizenship unless adopted. \nCitizenship law has changed over the years and different laws apply to determine whether you automatically became a U.S. citizen at birth. If you are claiming U.S. citizenship based on your birth outside the United States to a U.S. citizen parent, the law in effect on the date of your birth applies. Different provisions may apply depending on whether you were born in wedlock or out-of-wedlock. \nIf you are claiming U.S. citizenship after birth, but before you reached 18 years of age, the law that applies to you is the \nlaw in effect when the last qualifying condition was met. Generally, the conditions are listed below: \nThese conditions must be met before you turn 18 years of age: 1. Your parent must be a U.S. citizen; \n2. You must establish one of the parent-child relationships listed in Part 1., Item Number 2. of Form N-600; \n3. You must be lawfully admitted to the United States for lawful permanent residence; and \nForm N-600 Instructions 01/20/25 Page 1 of 12\n\nForm N-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 2 of 12 \n   \n \n \n \n  \n   \n 4. You must be living in the United States in the legal and physical custody of your U.S. citizen parent. \nNOTE:  If you are the child of: (1) a U.S. government employee; (2) a spouse of a U.S. government employee; (3) a \nmember of the Armed Forces of the United States; or (4) a spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States, \nand your parent is stationed outside of the United States, you may be exempt from the requirement to be living in the United States if you meet the conditions described in Section 320(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nYou can file Form N-600 at any time if you became a U.S. citizen at birth or before you turned 18 years of age.  Filing this application is NOT a request to become a U.S. citizen. Filing this application is ONLY a request to obtain a Certificate of \nCitizenship which recognizes that you became a citizen on a particular date. \nAdopted Child \nAn adopted child may also acquire U.S. citizenship through his or her adoptive U.S. citizen parent depending on the law \nbeing applied. Currently, an adopted child can acquire U.S. citizenship through his or her U.S. citizen parent. \nNOTE:  If you are now over 18 years of age, but all of the above conditions apply to you before your 18th birthday and \nyou were under 18 years of age on February 27, 2001 (the date the law took effect), you may file this application to obtain \na Certificate of Citizenship. \nYou may file this application if: 1. You claim to have acquired U.S. citizenship through a U.S. citizen parent and are now over 18 years of age; or \n2. You are the U.S. citizen parent or legal guardian who has legal and physical custody of child (under 18 years of age). \nLaw in Effect at the Time of Your Birth or While Under Age 18 \nTo determine if you were born a U.S. citizen, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) must look at the law \nthat was in effect at the time of your birth. To determine if you acquired citizenship after birth, USCIS generally must look at the law in effect before you turned 18. The law currently in effect, the Child Citizenship Act (CCA), applies only to those children born on or after February 27, 2001, or those who were under 18 years of age as of that date. \nWho Should Not File Form N-600? \nYou should not file this application if: \n1. You do not have at least one U.S. citizen parent; \n2. Your parent-child relationship does not satisfy one of the categories listed in Part 1., Item 2. of Form N-600; \n3. You are seeking to replace a certificate you lost or that was stolen.  Refer to Form N-565, Application for Replacement \nNaturalization/Citizenship Document, for information to replace a lost or stolen certificate; or \n4. You already filed Form N-600 and received a decision from USCIS on that previously filed Form N-600.  USCIS will reject (not accept) any subsequently filed Form N-600. Review your Form N-600 denial notice for more information. \nNOTE:  If you are under 18, are the child of a U.S. citizen parent, you regularly reside outside the United States, and you \ndid not acquire U.S. citizenship at birth under INA sections 301 or 309, your U.S. citizen parent, U.S. citizen grandparent, or U.S. citizen legal guardian may need to file Form N-600K, Application for Citizenship and Issuance of Certificate Under Section 322, instead of Form N-600. Please review the Instructions for Form N-600K to determine whether you should file that form instead of Form N-600. If you are over 18, do not file Form N-600K.\n\nForm N-600 Instructions  01/20/25 Page 3 of 12 \n   \n  \n \n  \n  General Instructions \nWe provide free forms through the USCIS website.

The child is under 18 years of age and not married;\n2. The child must remain under 18 years of age and unmarried throughout the application process, including the \nadministration of the Oath of Allegiance;\n3. The child has one of the following relationships to a U.S. citizen parent:\n• The biological child of a U.S. citizen parent.  (The child’s U.S. citizen parent must also be their legal parent.  If the U.S. citizen parent is the child’s biological father, you will generally have to establish that the child was born in wedlock or legitimated.);\n• The child of a non-genetic gestational U.S. citizen parent (person who carried and gave birth to the child) who is also the child’s legal parent;\n• The child of a U.S. citizen parent who was married to the child’s genetic or gestational parent at the time of the child’s birth (even if no genetic or gestational relationship exists with the U.S. citizen parent) and both of the child’s parents are also the child’s legal parents; or\n• The adopted child of a U.S. citizen parent.  You must have a full, final, and complete adoption and meet the requirements of one of the following provisions for adoption-based immigration:  Hague Adoption Convention, including having an approved Form I-800; orphan, including having an approved Form I-600; or family-based adoption, including having an adoption before age 16 (or age 18 if the sibling exception at INA 101(b)(1)(E)(ii) applies), and two years of legal custody and joint residence with the adoptive parent.\nNOTE:  Stepchildren are not eligible for citizenship through a U.S. citizen stepparent, unless the U.S. citizen stepparent adopted the stepchild and the stepchild meets the requirements applicable to adopted children.\n4. The child resides outside the United States;\n5. The child is in the legal and physical custody of the U.S. citizen parent; \nIn cases where the U.S. citizen parent died in the preceding five years, the child does NOT  have to be residing in \nthe legal and physical custody of the person filing the application, as long as the person who has legal and physical custody of the child does not object to the Form N-600K;\n6. The child’s U.S. citizen parent has been physically present in the United States for a period or periods totaling at least five years, at least two of which were after 14 years of age.  If the U.S. citizen parent does not meet this requirement, the U.S. citizen parent’s own U.S. citizen parent (the child’s grandparent) has to have been physically present in the United States for a period or periods totaling at least five years, at least two of which were after 14 years of age; and\n\nForm N-600K Instructions   01/20/25    Page 2 of 12\n7.

The child does not need to demonstrate the temporary physical presence, lawful admission, or maintenance of lawful status requirements to be eligible for naturalization under INA section 322.  Additionally, the military member may count any time spent outside the United States on official U.S. military orders as physical presence in the United States.\nHowever, a child under these circumstances who is a lawful permanent resident may have already acquired citizenship, \nand therefore cannot obtain a Certificate of Citizenship through the N-600K process.  See the USCIS Policy Manual V olume 12, Part H - Children of U.S. Citizens, Chapter 4, Automatic Acquisition of Citizenship after Birth (INA 320) at www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12-part-h-chapter-4.\nWho May File Form N-600K?\nThe following individuals may file this application on behalf of an eligible for eign-born child:\n1.

      "instructions": "Instructions for \nMedical Certification for Disability Exceptions \nDepartment of Homeland Security\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration ServicesUSCIS\n Form N-648\nOMB No. 1615-0060\nExpires 09/30/2027   \n \n \n   \n What is the purpose of Form N-648? \nThis form is filled out and certified by certain medical professionals on behalf of applicants who are requesting an \nexception from the English and/or civics requirements for naturalization because of a disability and/or impairment. \nDefinition of Disability and/or Impairment(s) for Exception from Literacy Requirements \nAn applicant is eligible for this exception if they are unable to learn and/or demonstrate knowledge of English and/ \nor U.S. history and civics because of a physical or developmental disability , or mental impairment (or a combination \nof impairments). The disability and/or impairment must result from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities, which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques. The disability \nand/or impairment must result in functioning so impaired that the applicant is unable to demonstrate the required knowledge. \nNOTE: The definition of disability used for this exception may be different from the definition used for other purposes \n(for example, for Social Security Administration programs, Department of Veterans Affairs programs, and state \nworker’s compensation programs).  If your responses do not address how the applicant’s disability affects their ability to learn English and civics, we will request that the applicant submit a revised or second Form N-648 with the required information. \nWho should submit Form N-648 and when? \nApplicants for naturalization seeking an exception to the English and/or civics requirements for naturalization because of a physical or developmental disability or mental impairment should submit this form when they file Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Applicants whose N-648 \nhas been found sufficient do not have to fulfill the English and/or civics requirements if they cannot do so because of a \nphysical or developmental disability or mental impairment. (See Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 312(b)(1)). USCIS may not consider a Form N-648 if the certifying medical professional completed this form more than 180 days before the submission of Form N-400 to USCIS. \nWho should not submit Form N-648? \nApplicants who can satisfy the English and civics requirements for naturalization with reasonable accommodations provided under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 do not need to submit this form.  Reasonable accommodations include, but are not limited to, sign language interpreters, extended time for testing, and off-site examination. Applicants may request \na disability accommodation online at uscis.gov/accommodations or by calling the USCIS Contact Center at \n800-375-5283 (TTY 800-767-1833). However, if you are unable to complete the English and/or civics requirements \neven with an accommodation, you must file Form N-648 to request an exception from these requirements. Illiteracy and \nadvanced age alone are not valid reasons to seek an exception from the English and/or civics requirements. For additional \ninformation, go to www.uscis.gov/about-us/disability-accommodations-for-the-public. \nForm N-648 Instructions 09/25/24 Page 1 of 5\n\nForm N-648 Instructions  09/25/24 Page 2 of 5 \n   \n \n \n  \n   \n  How to Complete This Form \nThe certifying medical professional must have conducted an examination of the applicant before certifying Form N-648. \nParts 1. - 3. must be completed and certified by a licensed medical professional. If a telephonic or video facilitated \ninterpreter was used, the certifying medical professional must also complete Part 5. Interpreter Information and \nCertification. \nUSCIS may accept a Form N-648 certified by an authorized medical professional who completed the applicant’ s medical \nexamination through telehealth. The medical professional should be licensed, and telehealth examinations should be \nsynchronous, real-time interactions between the medical professional and the applicant. \nThe applicant for naturalization must complete Part 6. Applicant’s (Patient’s) Attestation/Release of Information. \nThe certifying medical professional must answer all questions and items fully and accurately .  USCIS will not accept an \nincomplete Form N-648. If handwritten, all responses must be legible and written in black ink. USCIS recommends that \nthe certifying medical professional use the electronic Form N-648 located in the “FORMS” section at www.uscis.gov/n-648. The certifying medical professional must provide the completed form to the applicant for submission to USCIS. For electronic filing of naturalization applications, the N-648 may be uploaded as additional evidence. \nFailure to provide all information requested on the form may result in USCIS determining that the form is insufficient. \nIn addition to providing a detailed assessment of any of the applicant’ s physical or developmental disabilities or mental \nimpairments that may affect the applicant’s ability to successfully complete the English and/or civics requirements, the certifying medical professional completing the form may attach supporting medical diagnostic reports or records. However, these attachments may not take the place of written responses to each question or item on Form N-648. \nInformation the certifying medical professional (you) should include in Part 3. Information about Disabilities and/or \nImpairments: Information Needed for Item Number 1. \nYou should provide the clinical diagnosis of the applicant’s medical disability and/or impairment that forms the basis for \nseeking an exception to the English and/or civics requirements. \nAlso, in Item Number 1., the certifying medical professional needs to explain, in as much detail as possible, how each \ndisability and/or impairment prevents the applicant from learning English and/or civics. In other words, you should \nexplain how the disability and/or impairment causes the applicant’ s inability to learn English and/or civics. \nResponses should use clear and common terminology, without abbreviations, that a person without medical training can understand. For example: “The patient’s condition is a global, lifelong impairment that severely affects cognition, language, and motor skills. Because of this impairment, the patient’s memory is deficient, the patient cannot learn new skills, and the patient is not capable of reasoning. The patient is only able to perform simple daily activities. The patient’s severe intellectual disability makes the patient incapable of learning a new language (even basic words) and demonstrating the required knowledge of U.S. history and government.” \nInformation Needed for Item Number 2. \nExplain which clinical methods or laboratory diagnostic techniques you used to diagnose each of the applicant’ s medical \ndisability and/or impairments. \nFor example: “The patient was diagnosed in utero through a Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS).  CVS is a test done during \nearly pregnancy that can identify certain genetic disorders or chromosomal birth defects, such as ‘Severe intellectual \ndisabilities.’  I confirmed this by reviewing medical records provided by the patient.”\n\nForm N-648 Instructions  09/25/24 Page 3 of 5 \n    \n  \n \n \n \n  Part 4. Ability to Understand Oath of Allegiance \nInformation Needed for Item Number 1. \nIn order to obtain an oath waiver because of a medical disability , an applicant must have a legal guardian, surrogate, or \ndesignated representative to complete the naturalization process. In the absence of a legal guardian or surrogate, a U.S. \ncitizen spouse, parent, adult son or daughter, or adult brother or sister who is the primary custodial caregiver and who \ntakes responsibility for the applicant can serve as the designated representative. \nPart 5. Interpreter Information and Certification.  If in-person interpretation services were used during the medical \nexamination, the interpreter must fill out this section and sign and date the certification. If telephonic interpretation \nservices were used during the medical examination, the certifying medical professional must complete all items in this \nsection, except Item Number 6. \nGeneral Instructions \nUSCIS provides forms free of charge through the USCIS website.
